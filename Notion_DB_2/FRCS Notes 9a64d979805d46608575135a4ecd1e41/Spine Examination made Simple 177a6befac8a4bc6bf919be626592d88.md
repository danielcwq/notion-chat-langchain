# Cervical Spine Exam made Simple

### [STANDING/ SITTING]

- Look
    - Look Front - scars, cervical scoliosis
    - Side - Excessive lordosis/ kyphosis
    - Posterior - scars, sweling, slignment
- Move
    - Flexion, extension
    - lateral flexion
    - Lateral rotation

### [STAND AND WALK]

- "Before i palpate your spine, i would like to see your gait"
- Gait - broad based, notice the use of walking aids, "uncoordinated and clumsy on turning"
- Try again without aids
- Do tandem gait, screening with walking on toes and toes up
- Stop and do Romberg's test

### [SIT]

- Before palpating, check 2 signs
    - Finger escape
        - Ask patient to face the palm down; in this position, little finger goes into slight abduction and cannot be held in adduction for more than 30 seconds. If more advanced, will also affect the 4th finger
        - Described in 1987 by Ono as due to "poorly innervated palmar interosseous muslces due to myelopathy"[https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/HS/Finger+escape+sign](https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/HS/Finger+escape+sign)

    - Grip and release (20 in 10 seconds)
- **Palpate** from posterior
    - Midline tenderness
    - Paravertebral muscles
- Power
    - Deltoids - check this first for practical comparison post op (C5 palsy)
    - Use ASIA scoring for C5 - T1
        - C5 - biceps
        - C6 - wrist extension
        - C7 - triceps extension
        - C8 - isolate FDP
        - T1 - finger abduction
- Sensation
    - Use ASIA scoring for the dots - note the hand is check on dorsum

- Reflexes
    - Biceps
    - Triceps
    - Inverted supinator
        - Tapping brachioradialis ➔ hyperactive finger flexion
        - Mechanism is controversial. Traditionally understood to be due to C5 root lesion
        - Distal to lesion ➔ there is hyperactive reflexes (UMN)
        - At the level ➔ there is hypoactive response (No brachioradialis reflex)
- **Function** - check with coin
- “At this point, i want to offer to do some provacative tests such as”
    - Lhermitte's test (which is flexion and axial loading of neck to produce electric shock like pain in limbs)
    - Spurling's which is extension, rotation and axial loading to produce pain in radiculopathy
- If Myelopathic ➔ Lie down and check LL for :
    1. Tone and Clonus (log roll and ankle dorsiflexion) 
    2. hyper-reflexia, 
    3. Babinski
- Complete my examination with PR

# Lumbar Spine Exam made Simple

### [STANDING] - watch for AS and if present, switch gear and give AS spill

- Look
    - Expose
    - Front - scars - previous ops can affect approach,
    - Back - scars, hairy patch, cafe au lait spots, scoliosis, head alignment is balanced over pelvis, shoulders are balanced, no thoracic curves
    - Sagittal - neutral with head over pelvis, no excessive kyphosis or lordosis, no hip or knee flexion noted
        - if hips and knee bent - ask to straighten and see loss of sagittal balance
- Move
    - Flexion, extension - if limited, say “will quantify with Schober’s test”
    - Schober’s test
        - Mark a horizontal line at the level of the posterior superior iliac spines (PSISs) and a second at a distance of 10 cm above this.
        - On forward flexion this distance should increase by at least 5 cm
    - Side bending - hand by side, reach towards side of knee
    - Rotation - stabilize pelvis or sit on couch and rotate

### [WALK AND FEEL]

- Walk up and down until stop
- Gait - foot drop, antalgic, myelopathic broad based gait
- Screen with tip toe and toes up
- **Palpate** spinous process and paraspinal muscles

### [LIE DOWN]

- Check power - from L2 downwards to S1 [now at foot of bed]
- Check sensation based on ASIA scoring [check from S1 since at foot of bed and go upwards]]
    - S1 - lateral aspect of heel
    - L5 - first web space
    - L4 - Medial malleolus
    - L3 - medial of patella
    - L2 - proximal thigh

    - Most normal people occiput will touch the wall and OWD is 0.
    - Abnormal is **> 2cm**
- Palpate the back spinous process
- **Sit** and check chest expansion >5cm
    - Come to front, check for chest expansion with hands **below nipple line** and expand
