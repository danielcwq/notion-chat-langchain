### Gamekeeper’s/ Skier’s Thumb (‼️)

- Which term is for chronic?
    - Gamekeeper = chronic
    - Skier = acute
- Components of the Ulnar Collateral Ligament?
    
    ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled.png)
    
    - UCL **proper** – tight in flexion
    - UCL **accessory** – tight in extension
- Usually injury is on which side?
    - Rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament
    - Avulsion fracture of the ulnar–volar base of the **proximal phalanx** (displaced or not) or **both**
- Thumb UCL Injury tests?
    - Stress both at **extension** and **30° of MCP flexion**
        - radial instability in 30° of flexion indicates injury to **proper** UCL
        - radial instability in extension indicates injury to **accessory** and proper UCL +/- volar plate
    - **Palpate** for **Stener Lesion** = avulsed ligament/ bone displaced above adductor pollicis aponeurosis
        - Will not heal without surgery
- How do you grade this injury?
    - Based on extent of valgus laxity
        - Grade 1 = sprain
        - Grade 2 = < 15 ° relative to contralateral thumb with firm end point ( Partial)
        - Grade 3 = > 15 ° without firm end point (complete)

    - **Dorsal**, Extensor tendon splitting approach
        - Incision - straight line incision
        - Split extensor tendon appartus along midline longitudinal fibers of the tendon, avoid incision too distally to avoid injury of central slip
            
            ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2016.png)

    - Type 1 = < 30% joint surface
    - Type 2 = 30 – 50%
    - Type 3 = > 50% unstable
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2017.png)
        
- Surgical management of each type?
    - **Type 1** = Reduce in flexion, apply dorsal extension blocking splint (use extensor tendons as tension band)
    - **Type 2** = try reducing. If require flexion > 30 degrees = unstable ➔ ORIF
    - **Type 3 ORIF.**
        - If bone stock poor, **hemi-hamate autograft**
            - Graft from the distal articulating surface of hamate - resembles very closely the form of the base of the middle phalanx
            
            ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2018.png)

### ****Scaphoid Fractures/ Non-union  (‼️)****

- ‼️ What is the blood supply of the scaphoid?
    - It has a dual blood supply, **both from radial artery**
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2023.png)
        
    - 80% is retrograde from the **dorsal carpal branch** which supplies the proximal pole (also from radial artery)
    - 20% is antegrade from the **superficial palmar branch** from Radial artery
- Why is scaphoid prone to AVN?
    - Articular cartilage 75%
    - Retrograde blood supply
- Which part of scaphoid is fractured most commonly?
    - Waist > Proximal pole > distal pole
- What are the risks of non union based on location?
    - Proximal pole 100%, **proximal 1/3** 30%, **waist** 20%, **distal** 10%
- What is humpback deformity?
    - due to intact SL ligament extending proximal pole as the lunate moves with the triquetrium (LT ligament extends)
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2024.png)

    ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2026.png)
    
    - PA, Obliques (supinated + pronated), Ulnar deviated PA, Lateral

### SCENARIO: ACUTE FRACTURE

- ‼️ What advanced imaging for no fracture on XR? Which better?
    - No consensus on the best imaging modality - MRI, CT, Bone scan,
    - personally, I will use MRI as my institution can obtain it rather quickly, and it has no risks of radiation.
    - Options are CT, MRI or Bone scan. I will do CT scan if concerned about costs and speed. MRI if concerns about radiation, no issue on availability and costs.
    - Recent Cochrane review in 2015 compared the 3 modalities in 11 studies. **All three imaging tests were found to be highly accurate** for definitive diagnosis. CT and MRI were comparable in diagnostic accuracy (the correct diagnosis is made). **Although BS had significantly better accuracy** than CT and MRI, it could lead to more people receiving unnecessary treatment.[https://www.cochrane.org/CD010023/MUSKINJ_comparing-different-types-of-scan-ct-mri-bone-scan-for-diagnosis-of-clinically-suspected-scaphoid-fractures-when-initial-radiographs-are-negative](https://www.cochrane.org/CD010023/MUSKINJ_comparing-different-types-of-scan-ct-mri-bone-scan-for-diagnosis-of-clinically-suspected-scaphoid-fractures-when-initial-radiographs-are-negative)
    - Mallett et al. JBJS 2011 Both CT and MRI comparable. Both better at excluding scaphoid fractures.

- ⚠️ What is the classification?
    - **Herbert**
    - A = **Stable** Fractures =
        - A1 Tubercle or
        - A2 **Incomplete waist**
    - B = **Unstable** Fractures
        - B1 = distal oblique
        - B2 = complete Waist
        - B3 = proximal pole - as long as proximal pole (displaced or undisplaced) = unstable!
        - B4 = transscaphoid perilunate
    - C = Delayed union
    - D = Established non union
    
    ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2027.png)
    
- What kind of cast? Does the thumb need to be immobilized?
    - Not essential.
    - JBJS 1991 RCT by Clay et al. 392 patients allocated to either standard Colles cast or thumb spica casted to IPJ. **No difference in non union after 6 months**

- What is the **management** for **UNDISPLACED** WAIST (Herbet stable) Scaphoid fracture?
    - Treatment for undisplaced scaphoid fracture is controversial and depends on Patient factors
        - Elderly, low function ➔ **Cast** total **12 weeks (3 months!)**
        - Young, working, wants to RTW earlier ➔ Percutaneous **screw**
    - **SWIFFT** study - Lancet 2020 Joseph Diaz et al.
        - Bicortical waist fracture displaced < 2mm
        - No difference in op vs no op in functional outcomes at 52 weeks
        - More patients had complications from surgery.
        
        [10.1016@S0140-67362030931-4.pdf](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/10.1016S0140-67362030931-4.pdf)
        
    - Based on **McQueen et al. 2008 RCT** in JBJS. RCT of 60 patients with undisplaced WAIST fractures into 2 groups 30 screw, 30 Colles cast.
        - Trend towards higher rate of nonuion in non op group (but not statistically significant)
        - Surgery had more rapid return of function, sport and work.

- What is the **management** of **DISPLACED** WAIST Scaphoid fracture?
    - Patient and Injury factors
    - P - well, high function
    - Reccomendation will be ORIF to reduce the risk of non union
    - **Singh et al. Injury 2012 Meta-analysis** of 1400 scaphoids. Displaced WAIST fractures **4 x higher risk** of nonunion if treated in cast.

- ‼️ What are the approaches to the scaphoid?
    - “balance between **cartilage damage** (more in dorsal) vs trajectory for screw (better for dorsal) - mostly 75% is done palmar…
    - **1. Volar** – Trans FCR tendon down
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2028.png)
        
    - **2. Dorsal approach** – Incision centered on Lister’s tubercle **between 3rd and 4th extensor compartments.** Beware **SRN!** [same approach as dorsal approach for perilunate]****
    - **3.** **Dorsolateral aka dorsoradial** approach - **between 1st and 3rd** extensor compartments. **[**same as the approach used to approach base of thumb]
- Describe the volar approach to scaphoid?
    - I - scaphoid tubercle, along FCR tendon
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2029.png)
        
    - Ligate the superficial palmar branch of radial artery, retract FCR tendon ulnarly ➔ incise capsule and RSC ligament obliquely
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Trauma%20and%20Fractures%2024ae9d26daed483284b04796e0e01f57/Untitled%2030.png)

- Which approach for which kind of fracture/ nonunion?
    - Because the scaphoid flexes forward
    - Only makes sense that proximal pole ➔ dorsal
    - Distal pole ➔ Volar

### SCENARIO: NONUNION/ AVN

    - Osseous resorption ➔ Pseudocysts ➔ Osteosclerosis ➔ Osteoarthritis (SNAC)
- How do you investigate nonunion?
    - CT scan - look at morphology of humpback
    - MRI with contrast - look for AVN
- What does AVN look like on XR?
    - XR would show **sclerosis**, not radiolucency!

- How do you know there is AVN vs just non union? What advanced imaging?
    - **Gold standard** is Intraoperative assessment where by perfusion to the scaphoid is assessed by puncturing the proximal pole to visually inspect for signs of bleeding; this serves as the gold standard to which imaging modalities are then compared.
    - Pre op,
        - **MRI with contrast** found to have higher sensitivity and specificity
        - **CT scans** found not to correlate with vascularity
        - MRI more reliable
- What is the Diagnostic criteria for avascular necrosis on MRI with contrast?
    - Hypointensity on T1 + T2
    - Lack of enhancement on fat-suppressed T1-weighted post-gadolinium sequences
    - T1 post contrast ➔ showing enhancement ➔ no AVN
    - T1 post contrast ➔ no enhancement ➔ AVN
- ‼️ How does presence of AVN affect your management?
    - Traditionally, presence of AVN will indicate the need for a vascularized bone graft. As such, if there is AVN, …
    - **AVN** = need vascularized graft
        - **Dorsal VBG** - Zaidemberg graft (1,2 Intercomparmental Supraretinacular artery ICSRA) [cf. kien bock is 2,3 ICSRA]

        - **Volar VBG -** from radial branch of palmar radiocarpal arch

        - **Free VBG** - Medial femoral condyle
    - **No AVN** = no need vascularized graft ➔ can be either Fisk interpositional or Ruse inlay. **Choose depending on the need to correct deformity**
        - Unstable or need to correct deformity = need structural support = **Fisk interpositional** iliac crest graft

        - If Stable = **Ruse inlay** graft

- What is your post op plan after fixation for AVN and Non union?
    - “I will cast to union”
- Does AVN always require VBG?
    - No. Recent studies show that even with NVBG, union rates can be expected to be 80-90%
- Which approach for which kind of fracture/ nonunion?
    - Because the scaphoid flexes forward
    - Only makes sense that proximal pole ➔ dorsal
    - Distal pole ➔ Volar

- TRIQUETRIUM (**❌)**
    - How common is triquetrium fracture?
        - second most common carpal fracture after scaphoid!

- HAMATE (**❌)**
    - What is the biomechanics of the hook of hamate?

        - Biomechanical function of the hook is to act as a pulley for the flexor tendons of the ring and small fingers
    - What is the pull test?
        - pull on RF and LF – tendons pushing on hook causing pain
