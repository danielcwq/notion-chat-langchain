- ‼️ What is this [Club foot]? Describe the Picture
    - Clinical photo of club foot -
    - Hindfoot - Varus and Equinus
    - Midfoot - Cavus
    - Forefoot - Adducted and Pronated (1st MT more flexed than 5MT)
    - Shortened Tibia/ Smaller calves - (can eventually get some LLD about 1cm.)
    - aka Congenital Talipes Equinovarus
- ‼️ What do you want to assess for?
    - **History** from parents - familiy history
    - Confirm **structural** - unable to dorsiflex to touch anterior shin
    - Assess for **atypical** clubfoot - features
    - **Neurovascular** status - presence of ATA (associated with dysgenesis - ATA may be absent in as many as 90% of club foot!), moving toes, tone
    - Assess for syndromes - **arthrogryposis** of other joints,
    - Assess for associated conditions - **DDH** (20% incidence!)
    - Check the **spine** - Spinal dysraphism
- ‼️ What are the 5+1 features of atypical club foot?
    - Short **chubby** foot
    - Short **hyperextended** great toe
    - Deep **medial crease** on the sole [Pirani]
    - Deep **posterior crease [pirani]**
    - Plantar **flexion of all metatarsals**
    - **SLIPPING CAST**
    - **Solution**: deal with the plantarflexion first to prevent cast slippage. (slightly different from usual club foot), KIV early TA release.
    - Atypical only suggests difficulty in treatment, does not necessary mean more

- What are the types and etiologies of club foot?
    - Most common is **idiopathic**
    - **Syndromic** causes
        - Arthrogryposis - if they show hand and other joints contracture
            
            ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%202.png)
            
        - Amniotic band syndrome
            
            ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%203.png)
            
        - Larsen syndrome
- ‼️ What is the pathoanatomy?
    - Complex with **bony** and **soft tissue** abnormalities
    - **Bony (4 bone)**
        - Calcaneum - varus and medially rotated
        - Talus - medially rotated
        - Navicular and cuboid - displaced medially
        - Metatarsals adducted and pronated
    - **Soft tissue**
        - Ligaments - deltoid and spring ligaments tight
        - Tendons
            - Tendoachilles - causes varus and equinus
            - FDL and FHL - causes Midfoot cavus
            - Tibialis Posterior - Forefoot adduction
    
    ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%204.png)
    
- What is the incidence?
    - 1:1000 (like most conditions)
    - M > F
    - 50% bilateral!`
- ‼️ What classification Of club foot?
    - Pirani scoring looking at 3 hindfoot and 3 midfoot features - also features of typical, complex club foot. Each one 0 - 1. Max is 6
    
    ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - **Hindfoot** - rigid equinus (ability to go beyond 90), Empty heel, posterior crease
    - **Midfoot** - medial fold (deep transverse creas), talar head palpability, lateral border curvature
- When will you ever do XR?
    - Hardly ever.
    - In relapse club foot
    - XR to look at cuneiforms
- What can you see on XR though not often done?
    - **Normal foot - usually there is no parallelism.**
    - "PARALLELISM" in the Talo-calcaneal angles (Kite angle)
        
        ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%206.png)

## MX OF CLUBFOOT - **5 things** - Ponsetti, Tenotomy, FAO, Transfer, Surgery

- What is **Ponsetti** Casting?
    - It is a **Toe to groin** cast, with **weekly** change for about **6 casts**
    - Correction with **Talar head** as the fulcrum.
    - First cast is supinate forefoot by elevating 1st ray and then followed by CAVE order.
    - Ponsetti technique also includes the achilles tendon release
- What is the biomechanic properties behind the ponsetti cast?
    1. Soft tissue - describe viscoelastic properties **Creep** and **Stress Relaxation**
    2. Bone remodelling - **Heuter-volkmann principle** on the bones for calcaneum and talus
    3. Done earlier - **Maternal hormones oxytocin** still in the baby leads to quicker relaxation
- ⚠️ Can you do below knee cast?
    - No. Due to high rates of failure.
    - **Maripuri et al. RCT in BJJ 2013** of 33 feet. Trial prematurely stopped due to high failure rates of 37%
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24151281/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24151281/)
- What if you get a rocker bottom foot halfway through?
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-07-29 at 8.51.45 AM.png](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Screenshot_2022-07-29_at_8.51.45_AM.png)
    
    - This means that the caster has progressed too quickly to correct equinus
    - Solution - to reverse what has been done and repeat casting
- What material?
    - Plaster of paris vs Fiber glass. **No difference**
    - Douglas et al. RCT in JPO 2008 of 42 club feet
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18388724/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18388724/)
    - There was a trend toward higher scores for cast tolerance, durability, and parent satisfaction in the fiberglass group, but this did not reach significance.
- How do you know you are on the Talus?
    - Identify lateral malleolus
    - Talus is directly anterior to it
    - Do not mistake 5MT base as the talus
- When will you do a **TA tenotomy**? Any investigation? **[Hindfoot stall]**
    - Attain **ER 60 degrees** first (too early will lead to rocker bottom)
    - Indication = DF < 15 degrees
    - Sometimes, DF may not be occuring at the tibiotalar joint but at the mid foot (but at the talonavicular joint) ➔ so to check, do lateral XR for **Tibiocalcaneal Angle**
    
    ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%209.png)
    
    - **< 80** degrees - no need tenotomy
    - **> 80** - high risk of relapse if tenotomy not done
- Why do you get a rocker bottom deformity?
    - When we try to correct equinus before varus is fully corrected
- ‼️ How do you do a tentomy? What structures you protecting?
    - LA - Can use **sucrose drops** as an effective mild analgesics in infants
        
        [Sucrose (oral) for procedural pain management in infants](https://www.rch.org.au/rchcpg/hospital_clinical_guideline_index/Sucrose_oral_for_procedural_pain_management_in_infants/)
        
    - Assistant hold in maximum dorsiflexion
    - Insert blade longitudinally, turn 90 degrees and cut
    - Protect - Medial tendons
    - No need Sutures, just put steri strips.
- LA vs GA for tenotomy? Clinic vs OT?
    - “When i am just starting out, I will consider doing under GA. Because LA infiltration can make it difficult to palpate the tendon achilles”
    - However, as I get more accustomed, I will progress to do under LA in order to minimize risks of GA
    - Consider GA if bilateral or atypical club feet
- How many % need TA tenotomy, AT transfer?
    - 90%, 30% respectively
- What after tenotomy?
    - Full cast in maximal dorsiflexion for 3 weeks until tenotomy heals
    - **Foot Abduction Orthosis** (commercial name is Dennis Brown Bar)

- What are the 5 key features of the **FAO**?
    - **5 key words** ; "Open toe, high top, straight lass shoes at shoulder width, attached to a bar"
- How do you wear the FAO? Duration?
    - Put in Abduction **70. Unaffected Side 30-40**
    - If both Feet - both **60 deg**
    - Oxford book: **"23 hours a day for 3 months, then night and naps until 5 years"**
    - Heel in, middle strap first
    - KKH protocol
        - Worn until 3-4 years old
        - First 3 months 24 hours, 22/20/18/16/14 for 5 months (8 months now) ➔ then night and naps to 2-4 years old.
            
            ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%2010.png)
            
- Importance of compliance of FAO?
    - Very important, markedly reduction after 3rd year, really try to enforce compliance to 3 years at least.
        
        ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- Other methods you aware of?
    - Kite's Method - casting but the fulcum is CC joint avg casting 20 weeks!
    - French Method - physiotherapy focused.
- What **gait** do we look out for?
    - Dynamic supination aka Swing phase supination
    - Due to spasticity of Tibialis anterior
- What is the management of Dynamic Supination gait?
    - Tibialis anterior transfer to lateral cuneiform
- Any deformity associated with this?
    - Dorsal bunion at 1st MTPJ. [Rare, or maybe only seen in adults] Slightly different pathology from CMT claw toes.
    - Overactvity of tibialis anterior that attach to base of first MT and first cuneiform lead to 1st MT dorsiflesion ➔ FHL overactivity to allow toe pulp to touch floor.

## RESISTANT/ RECURRENT/ RELAPSE/ NEGLECTED

- What is the natural history in neglected club foot?
    - Start to WB on lateral aspect of foot
        
        ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%2013.png)
        
- What are the definitions of terminologies?
    - **Resistant** - uncorrectable
    - **Recurrent** - recur DURING course of treatment
    - **Relapsed** - recur AFTER successful correction of ALL deformities
    - **Negected** - never treated.
- Management of RESISTANT clubfoot?
    - Rare, and need to assess personal application method of Ponseti. Usually high rate of success even in very stiff club feet associated with arthrogryposis
    - Ponsetti is very **effective even for arthrogryposis.** By second cast already alot of correction
    - if really resistant ➔ surgery
- Recurrence, Relapse, Neglected Club foot management?
    - **Ponsetti again! -** Ponsetti is successful even up to 6 years old! (spiegel CORR 2009)
    - Consider **MRI TRO spinal dysraphism** in relapse
    - If fail ➔ **Bony procedures**
    - If > 5 yo foot stiff already ➔ bony procedure
    - If > 10 yo ➔ salvage procedures like fusion and talectomy
    
    ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%2014.png)
    
- ‼️ What is the surgical approach to release club foot?
    - Cincinatti vs Turco approaches
    - Cincinnati = hemicircumfrential around hindfoot
        
        ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%2015.png)
        
    - Turco = medial curvilinear
        
        ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- What to release?
    - Plantar fascia
    - **Medial** structures - Abductor hallucis, TIb post, Knot of Henry, superficial deltoid, spring ligaments, talonavicular capsule, CC capsule
    - **Posterior** structures - posterior deltoid, posterior capsules of tibiotalar and Subtalar joints, calcaneofibular, talofibular, tendoachilles
- What bony procedures?
    - Calcaneum valgus osteotomy (Same as the one for pes Cavus)
    - Lateral column shortening, medial opening
    - KKH "Transcuneiform osteotomy" Mid tarsal osteotomy
        - Involves a transverse osteotomy from the cuboid to the medial cuneirofm without making a medial incision
            
            ![Untitled](Club%20Foot%207c3cd828ff194c78b42b633e9cf8d56b/Untitled%2017.png)
            
    - Circular frame
    - Salvage - Talectomy, Triple arthrodesis
