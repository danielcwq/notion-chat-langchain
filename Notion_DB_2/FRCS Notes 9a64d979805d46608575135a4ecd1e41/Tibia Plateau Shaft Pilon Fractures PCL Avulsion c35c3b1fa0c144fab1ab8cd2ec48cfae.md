### Tibia Plateau Fractures

<aside>
üí° **Invx -** delineate fracture pattern, extension and
**Goal -** achieve a painfree, functional knee. in this intraarticular fracture, 
**Challenges** - reduction (adjuncts..), coronal fracture pattern which will require 2 incisions, bone void management

</aside>

- What is the classification?
    - Schatzker Classifx - split ‚ûî Split and depressed ‚ûî depression only ‚ûî "go to other side" ‚ûî "bi" ‚ûî Dissociation
    
    ![Untitled](Tibia%20Plateau%20Shaft%20Pilon%20Fractures%20PCL%20Avulsion%20c35c3b1fa0c144fab1ab8cd2ec48cfae/Untitled.png)
    
- What it the most common type? Which type is suspected never to exist?
    - Schatzker Type 2 most common
    - Type 3 - supposedly never happens
- Which type is associated with compartment syndrome?
    - Schatzker 6 type fracture with metaphyseal-dipahyseal dissociation
- Why does a schatzker 3 occur if it does occur? What MOI?
    - Flexion and valgus forces
    - Lateral tibia is convex in nature and less dense, coupled with the femoral roll back mechanism, isolated tibia depression fracture can occur.

- What do you know about Luo's classfication?
    - Divides tibia plateau into medial, lateral and posterior columns (anterior fibular head, **posteromedial ridge**, tibial tuberosity)
    
    ![Untitled](Tibia%20Plateau%20Shaft%20Pilon%20Fractures%20PCL%20Avulsion%20c35c3b1fa0c144fab1ab8cd2ec48cfae/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - Any break of cortical wall in any column constitutes fracture in that column
    - Schatzker 3 = 0 column; intact cortical surfaces.
    - Guides plate positioning and approach
- What investigation and what are you look for?
    - **CT scan to look for:**
    - Column invovlement with Luo's classification to help with surgical planning
    - Extent of depression - need for bone substitutes
    - Extent of fracture extension - extension of incisions
    - Intra-articular involvement
    - Fracture pattern - any coronal fracture line that requires Posterior plating
- What is your ACUTE mx?
    - ATLS, KIV Ex fix
    - Monitor for compartment syndrome
    - Span, Scan, Plan
- What is the DEFINITIVE Mx plan?
    - Aim = restore articular congruity, alignment, stable fixation, early ROM
    - Approach - based on 3 column theory
    - 0 column = AL approach; Lateral plate with rafting screws
    - 1 Columns
        - L only = AL approach; lateral plate
        - M only = M approach; medial plate
        - P only = P approach; posteromedial plate
        - P but posterolateral corner = Frosche Approach
    - 2 Columns
        - L + P (most common) = PM + AL
            - Fix Posterior first with PM plate
            - Then fix AL to it with Lateral plate
        - M + P = M/ PM approach; M + PM plates
        - M + L = AL + Medial approach;
    - 3 Columns
        - AL + PM Approach; need 3 plates
- How will you treat this patient?
    - Patient factors - young, high function
    - Injury factors - displaced, intra-articular
    - I will reccomend surgical fixation
- Option for primary TKR?
    - Considerations - tibia tuberosity fracture cannot do.
- What adjuncts?
    - Femoral distractor
    - Arthroscopy to evaluate meniscus and help in reduction of articular surface KIV repair
    - **Bone substitutes for bone void ‚Äì lack of consensus**. Consider calcium phosphate as highest compressive strength
        - [Murphy: no evidence; especially with locking plates]
- Scenario: How do you fix this Schatzker 2 Fracture?

    - This is a Schatzker2 injury, Based on CT scan, the lateral column is involved, medial and posterior columns are not
    - There is no coronal fracture line
    - Amenable to single plate fixation...
- Scenario: How do you fix this Schatzker 5 Fracture?
    
    ![Untitled](Tibia%20Plateau%20Shaft%20Pilon%20Fractures%20PCL%20Avulsion%20c35c3b1fa0c144fab1ab8cd2ec48cfae/Untitled%204.png)
    
    - This is a Schatzker 5, bicondylar fracture. CT scan show coronal fracture line, partial avusion of TT, involvement all 3 columns
    - Will require PM approach - fix buttress with perpendicular screws across coronal fragment
    - and AL approach
- Sequence of fixation in bicondylar?
    - Fareed: ‚ÄúAlways fix the medial column first, then fix lateral column to it‚Äù
    - Medial is usually less comminuted
- What are the relative indications for primary arthroplasty?
    - Pre-existing SEVERE cartilage defect
    - High risk of fixation failure - elderly osteoporotic, articular comminution, significant bone loss, non compliance
    
    ![Untitled](Tibia%20Plateau%20Shaft%20Pilon%20Fractures%20PCL%20Avulsion%20c35c3b1fa0c144fab1ab8cd2ec48cfae/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - If immediate weight bearing is desired
- What will you prepare pre-op and what considerations?
    - Need to restore joint line
    - Bone stock and fixation - need to stand by stems, cones and sleeves
    - Need II
    - Stand by adjuncts to fix fracture - plates
- How do you evaluate joint line in TKR when entire tibia plateau is fractured?
    - 1cm above tip of fibula
    - 2.5cm below medial epicondyle

### Tibia Shaft Fractures

<aside>
üí° **Mx goal =** painless functional limb 
**Mx Principle =** if candidate fit for surgery, will aim for relative reduction and stability with IM rod
**challenges and Controversies** = Reduction (proximal is VP/ distal is varus recurvatum), reaming and (skin coverage if open)

</aside>

- What must you rule out?
    - [Compartment Syndrome](Compartment%20Syndrome%2062595a751c08456f9e4ef1c762f768ee.md)
- What is the standard starting point?
    - Just medial to lateral tibia spine
- Advantages of reaming?
    1. Reaming releases growth factors and bone graft at fracture site
    2. Biomechanically more stable as able to put in a bigger nail - Why?
    - [31. Fracture Fixation Principles](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e.md)
    1. Lower re-operation rates - Bhandari Sprint trial

- What is the effect of reaming and blood supply? How long does it take to revascularize?
    - Usual blood supply is **centrifugal,** from in to out with inner 2/3 supplied by the nutrient artery.
    - Reaming disrupts this blood supply BUT, it is able to compensate  with periosteal blood supply immediately, such that cortical blood supply is maintained (Reichert 1995) ‚ûî Blood supply becomes outside in (centripetal)

    - Valgus or varus failure
    - You can tell from the type of fibula fracture
    - If simple ‚ûî failed in varus
    - If comminuted ‚ûî failed in valgus
- What are the main fragments?
    - Volkmann‚Äôs Posterolateral Fragment (PITFL) - usually constant fragment as per Topliss paper
    - Chaput anterolateral fragment (AITFL)
    - Medial malleolus Fragment (Deltoid L)
    - Diepunch central fragment

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What classification for distal tibia fractures?
    - **Ruedi Allgower** Classification
        - Type 1 = **non-displaced**
        - 2 = simple, **displaced**
        - 3 = comminuted
    - AO Trauma - Bone 4, part 3 (4.3)
        - A = extra-articular
        - B = partial articular
        - C = complete articular
    - Topliss CT scan classification [Academic] - Broadly into 2 categories - coronal or sagittal fracture families
        - Sagittal Family
        - Coronal family
        
        ![Untitled](Tibia%20Plateau%20Shaft%20Pilon%20Fractures%20PCL%20Avulsion%20c35c3b1fa0c144fab1ab8cd2ec48cfae/Untitled%2012.png)
        
- How will you acutely manage this patient?
    - ATLS, Compartment, Ex fix, CT scan
    - Span, Scan, Plan

- Is fixing the fibula necessary in pilon fractures? Will you fix fibula at same setting?
    - Fixing the fibula first is the traditional Ruedi Allgower Approach
    - However, understand this is controversial
    - **Kyrulo** et al. 2015 JOT retrospective study of 111 patients in 3 groups - no fracture, fracture fixed, fracture unfixed
        - No difference in alignment outcomes
        - Significant increase in complication rates, most of which is need for hardware removal

        - Conclusion - not necessary to fix fibula
    - As such, I want to make the decision after CT scan and at definitive surgery and if i were to fix it at the ex fix setting, this would sacrifice that option
    - Pros however is that it can help achieve length during the ex fix.
- What are the options for definitive management?
    - ORIF allows early ROM
    - If severe PVD, DM ‚ûî definitive ring fixation
    - Severe comminution, low function ‚ûî primary fusion
- What are the adjuncts you can use for reduction?
    - Initial Ex fix/ femoral distractor to distract fragments
- What is the ORIF strategy for this patient?
    - I will use the Ruedi and Allgower principles which are - restoration of fibula length, anatomic reduction, fill defect with bone graft, fix articular block to shaft with medial buttress plate
    - **1. Restore fibula length to aid in reduction**
        - I will do this if it is a simple fracture, where I can achieve anatomic reduction and confident of my
        - If comminuted, I will not do this first, instead, bridge plate it at the end.
        - How do you know it is up to length?
            - 1. Dime Sign - unbroken curve from distal fibula to lateral process of talus

    - 2. Anatomic reduction of articular surface
        - I will assess the die punch fragment via an anteromedial approach, to ‚Äúopen the book‚Äù of the chaput fragment
        - Punch the articular surface back out, and address bone void
    - 3. Bone graft of metaphyseal defect
        - Allograft or Bone substitutes
    - 4. Fix articular block to shaft with AL or Medial plate

- What would be your strategy/ approaches to these fractures?
    - Anthony Garter - it will depend on the axial cut of the CT scan. "AM is the workhorse". **Because most times, the "book" opens on the medial side**
        
        ![Untitled](Tibia%20Plateau%20Shaft%20Pilon%20Fractures%20PCL%20Avulsion%20c35c3b1fa0c144fab1ab8cd2ec48cfae/Untitled%2016.png)
        
    - Posterior mal fragment is the first fragment to fix. It is often extended. so Reduce and fix with buttress plate, then reduce the rest to it

    - CYS - note that you can go through a AM incision (medial to Anterior tibialis), but the deeper plane can be an Anterior (in between EHL and EDL) or AL plane (lateral to EDL muscles) to apply AL plate via a AM incision
    - Naturally some combinations are not reccomended due to skin bridge issues.
        - Direct lateral approach will preclude PL and AL ‚ûî so unable to address the PM fragment, so not usually done
        - Direct medial approach - not commonly done also as it precludes PM or AM approahces
- Sample Cases strategy

    - Salvage vs amputation
        - Salvage
            - **Acute** **Shortening** to allow end to end repair of vessels (and subsequent lengthening)
            - Shunt/ **Vein** grafting
        - **Amputation**
    

### PCL Avulsion Injury

- What other injuries must you exclude?
    - This is likely a dashboard injury
    - So need to exclude posterior hip dislocation
- What investigation?
    - MRI - can look at other soft tissue
    - CT scan - can evaluate bony fragment
- What approach will you use to fix this?
    - Burks and Schaffer‚Äôs Approach, first described by them in 1990
    - Inverted L shaped incision with medial aspect going distally.
    - Plane - between semimembranosus and gastrocnemius muscle; utilizing the gastroc muscles to protect and retract the vessels away
    - Vertical incision down the joint capsule
    - If need more exposure - can release the gastroc head

- What other approach? [Trauma Audit]
    - Posterior approach - better trajectory from screws
    
    - Popliteal Fossa Approach (to Popliteal Artery)
        - P - prone
        - I - gently curved S-shaped incision with medial limb distally (SPN is lateral) at biceps muscle)

        - S - Identify the **short saphenous vein and medial sural cutaneous nerve** (from the tibial nerve) ‚ûî Trace this into the apex of the popliteal Fossa
        - At the apex, this is where the CPN separates from the tibial nerve.
        - From the tibial nerve, the popliteal artery and vein (Vein medial to artery) lies deep and medial to the tibial nerve
        - incise popliteal fascia proximally, following the tibial nerve ‚ûî CPN should split from the tibial berve at the apex of the incision

        - Structures - **Artery is deepest** ‚ûî Vein ‚ûî Nerve (AVN; also from medial to lateral)
        - Deep dissection ‚ûî Detach tendinous origin of the medial an lateral head of gastrocnemius
- How will you fix this fracture?
    - Can fix with cannulated screws with washers

- Post op what is your rehabilitation?
    - Jack‚Äôs brace, 4 point fixation brace with force translating tibia **anteriorly**
    - Start closed chain exercises - focusing on quadriceps
    - Avoid hamstring exercises to avoid displacing the fragment
