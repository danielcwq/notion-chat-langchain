- Draw the macroscopic anatomy of meniscus.

    - Look at own right knee and draw from top down perspective
    - **LM**– Smaller semicircular, Ant horn adjacent to ACL, post horn is anterior to MM, **Humphrey** (ant to PCL) and **wrisberg**, no coronary ligament, recess for popliteal tendon, no attachment to LCL or joint capsule
    - **MM** – Bigger C-shaped, **anterior horn anterior to ACL**, posterior is anterior to PCL, Coronary ligaments (less mobile), attached firmly to joint capsule and deep MCL
    - Anteriorly - intermeniscus (transverse) ligament
- Draw the cross section of fibres

    - 3 layers -
        - **Surface** parallel fibres
        - **Superficial** oblique fibres
        - **Deep** circumfrential fibres = provides hoop stresses
    - “Hoop stress”
- What are hoop stresses in the meniscus?
    - The arrangement of collagen fibres in the meniscus convert axial compressive forces into a radially directed (tension) force, which is distributed and resisted as hoop stresses within the meniscus.
- Contents of meniscus?
    - Type 1 collagen 90% = fibrocartilage
    - 10% - proteoglycans, elastin
- Blood supply of meniscus? Progression from embryo?
    - Lateral, middle and genicular arteries from Popliteal artery ➔ Perimeniscal Capillary Plexus (PCP)

    - Embrylogy blood supply = at birth completely vascularized ➔ by 9 months avascular central 3rd ➔ devascularization Continue until 10 yo!
    - Described with 3 zones
        - White-white zone - inner avascular
        - Red-white zone
        - Red-Redzone = peripheral vascular
- To what extent is each meniscus vascularized?
    - Lateral meniscus - 10-25%
    - Medial meniscus 10-30%
- Innervation of meniscus?
    - Only peripheral **2/3** innervated by type 1 (proprioception) and 2 (touch and pressure) nerve endings
- Function of meniscus?
    - **Load transmission** by increasing contact surface area with femur (50% goes through meniscus!)
    - **Shock absorption** - half stiffness of cartilage i.e. more elastic
    - **Articular conformity**
    - **Knee joint stability** = especially in absence of ACL, MM confers AP stability
    - **Lubrication** = via **sponge** phenomenon; participates in boost and weeping lubrication
    - **Proprioception** = due to nerve endings

- What happens in meniscectomy?
    - 1984 Fairbanks Seminal paper
    - Records changes found in knee joint up to 14 years after meniscectomy
    - Found narrowed joint space, flattening of femoral condyle after meniscectomy

- Where else can we find meniscus-like structures?
    - ACJ, SCJ, TFCC
