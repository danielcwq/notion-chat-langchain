- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What are the types of Osteosarcoma?
    - Primary or Secondary
    - **Primary** -
        - Within bone - intramedullary (95%)
        - On surface of bone
            - Parosteal (low grade and spares medullary canal),
            - Periosteal (intermediate grade surface OS),
            - High grade surface OS,
        - Telangiectatic
    - **Secondary** - paget's disease, post radiation
- Commonest sites?
