## THR Periprosthetic Fracture

- ‚ÄºÔ∏èClassification for Periprosthetic Fractures?
    - Unified Classification - ABCDEF
    - A = Apophysis
    - B = bed of implant
        - B1 = stable, B2 = unstable, B3 = Poor bone stock
    - C = Clear of implant
    - D = dividing 2 implants
    - E = Each of 2 bones (e.g. femur and tibia)
    - F = facing implant (e.g. acetabulum with hemi)

    - Similar to Vancouver Classifx

- What investigation?
    - Still need TRO infection!
    - CT scan to evaluate
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Management for each type in THR Periprosthetic Fractures?
    - **A = Fix** if displaced
        - E.g. GT fracture
    - **B1 = Fix**
        - Mostly extra medullary implants
        - If possible bridge who plate
    - **B2 = Revise**; But controversy if Cement mantle is well fixed can consider Fixation
        - **Uncemented** Long stem prosthesis bypassing defect by 2 cortical diameters
    - **B3 = Revise** with Bone stock/ Replace
        - Cortical strut allograft, impaction bone grafting (with cemented long stem), Allograft prosthesis composite, PFR
    - **C = ORIF**
    - **D = ORIF**
- #üìú How will you manage this UC B2 Fracture?
    - In general, I will **revise** a unstable B2 fracture. However, aware of new controversy where fixation may be considered if cement mantle is stable and anatomical reduction can be achieved.
    - Investigate - CT scan
    - Complex revision
    - Preop = anaesthesia review, prepare explant sets, uncemented long stems, Cement removal OSCAR
    - Intraop EEERRRR
        - **Exposure** = ensure adequate, posterior extensile
            - Clamp fragments down first - (if you do not do this, and attempt dislocation, fracture will spiral and break apart even more)
            - Dislocate the hip ‚ûî and remove the implant with clamps in place
        - **Explant** =
            - **Stem** - remove cement as much as possible with osteotome proximally, then OSCAR to remove distal cement and bone plug
            - Cup - evaluate cup to see condition (attempt to retain the acetabuar component, providing it is not loose or obviously worn, damaged or maopositioned.
        - **Fix the Fracture**
            - Fix fracture with periprosthetic fracture plates and cerclage wires
            - Consider putting reamer in the canal to act as a template to fix the bone around it
        - R =
            - Sequentially ream femur until chatter
            - Replace with the long stem uncemented, modular stem; bypass 2 cortical diameter (this is about 6cm - when we drill it is 34, 36mm..)
            - Cemented after osteotomy or presence of fracture may compomise osteotomy healing
    - Post Op R = Rehabilitation - may begin with TTWB x 2/52 ‚ûî PWB
- What is unique about periprosthetic fixation plates?
    - ‚ÄúAllows **polyaxial**, **monocortical** **locking** screws that can bypass the implant in the medullary canal‚Äù
    - Also has options for **attachment to the GT** for proximal fixation
    - Options for **cables** to attach to the plate
- Can you just fix a B2 unstable fracture?
    - yes. area of controversy
    - In general, I will revise a unstable B2 fracture. However, aware of new controversy where fixation may be considered if cement mantle is stable and anatomical reduction can be achieved.
- Can you just fix a B3 fracture?
    - Reoperation rates are high when B3 fractures have an ORIF and not revised. 30% reoperation rates vs 15%

## TKR Periprosthetic Fracture

- Extra classification for TKR fracture?
    - **Su and Associates** for level of fracture [Su for Site]
        - 1 = Supracondylar
        - 2 = touches component
        - 3 = Distal to component
    - **Rorabeck** for Stability
        - 1 = Non displaced, stable implant
        - 2 = Displaced, stable implant
        - 3 = Unstable implant regardless displacement
    - Felix and Associates for Tibia #
        - Type 1 = tibia plateau
        - 2 = bed of stem
        - 3 = distal to stem
        - 4 = tibial tubercle avulsion
- What are risk factors for TKR fracture?
    - Patient factors
    - Surgeon technique factors - anterior notching, stress risers from navigation pins, loosening
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Management principles for TKR Periprosthetic Fractures based on UC classification?
    - A = Fix if displaced
    - **B1 = Fix**
        - Plate
    - **B2 = Revise**
        - Long stem revision with metaphyseal sleeve
        - Sleeve vs cone? Sleeve is attached to implant. Cone is separate
    - **B3 = Replace**
        - Distal femur Replacement (DFR)
        - APC
    - **C = ORIF** (Supracondylar fracture, clear of implant)
        - **Retrograde nail**
            - Nail vs plate ‚Äì Weight bearing, requite sufficient bone for interlocking; open box design
        - Unilateral plate
        - Dual plating for very distal fractures
            - Additional of medial buttress plating to resist varus collapse
            - Plate options ‚Äì Philos plate (Koreans), Reverse distal tibia plates
    - D = ORIF
- Tibial tuberosity avulsion?
    - Usually avulsion at tibial tubercle
    - Cause ‚Äì patellar eversion, steroid use, systemic disease
    - Mx
        - Direct repair or conservative DO NOT WORK
        - Acute reconstruction provides best chance for salvage (using semitendinosus autograft/ allograft)
        - De-tension with cerclage wire
        - Late recon with achilles allograft
