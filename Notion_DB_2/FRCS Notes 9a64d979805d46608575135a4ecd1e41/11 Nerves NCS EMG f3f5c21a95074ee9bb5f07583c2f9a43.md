- ‼️ Types of nerve fibres and classification?
    - Numerical classification -
    - Type 1 (myelinated) = proprioception and **Motor**
    - Type 2 (myelinated) = touch and pressure
    - Type 3 (myelinated) = fast Pain
    - Type 4 (unmyelinated) = slow pain and Heat [implicated in radial tunnel syndrome whereby pain onsets earlier than neurological deficit]

- DRAW nerve conduction action potential? #draw
    
    ![Untitled](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - **Resting Potential** = both Na and K channels closed
        - Resting potential of -70mV due to high concentration of K+ and low concentration of Na+ and Cl- in cell
            - Opposite in extracellular
            - Maintained by lipid membrane and active Na/K pump, donnan equilibrium (large organic ion in cell)
    - **Depolarization** = Na+ channels open = Na influx
        - Threshold stimulus leads to depolarisation when it reaches about -50mV
    - **Repolarization** - Na+ channels close, K+ channels open. K+ efflux
        - Electric potential falls below -70mV due to delay of closure of K+ channels
    - ***Absolute** refractory period* begins when crosses the threshold potential and depolarization begins.
    - ***Relative** Refractory period* = After the overshoot and Active Na/K pump continues to work and brings back to resting potential. Relative because it just means that need larger depolarizing current to initiate action potential.
- How is action potential conducted?
    - Via saltatory conductance across nodes of ranvier
- What is the peripheral nervous system? DRAW

        - Goes into ventral spinal root (with motor nerve) ➔ White ramus into sympathetic ganglia ➔ 3 possible exits after synapsing with post ganglionic axons (white in grey out)
            - Pass **directly** to viscera and blood vessels
            - Pass via grey ramus to **accompany** motor nerve to tissue
            - Pass along sympathetic trunk to **another level**
    - Parasympathetic
        - Arises from CN 3,7,9,10,11 and S2-4 spinal nerves

- ‼️ What are the cells in the nervous system?
    1. Nerve cells i.e. neurons
    2. **Glial** cells - supportive cells, not involved in signalling.
        - Microglia - phagocytes
        - Macroglia
            - Schwann cells - produce myelin sheath in PNS
            - Olidodendocytes - produces myelin sheath in CNS
            - Astrocytes - form blood brain barrier
        
        ![Untitled](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Untitled%207.png)
        

## NERVE INJURIES

- How do you classify nerve injury?
    - By Seddon or Sunderland classification
    - **Seddon (shorter so only 3 stages)**
        - Neuropraxia (Sunderland 1)
        - Axonotmesis (Sunderland grades 2/3/4)
        - Neurotmesis (Sunderland 5)
    - **Sunderland (longer name so 5 stages)**
        - Grades 1-5
        - 1 = myelin sheath, (demyelination)
        - 2 = + axon, 3 = +endo, 4 = + perineurium,
        - 5 = + epi
- What are the Pathophysiologic stages of compressive neuropathy?
    - 1. Intermittent impairment of intraneural microcirculation - pressure of tissues > microcirculation pressure of epineural vessels
    - 2. Impairment of axonal transport +/- loss of myelin sheath
    - 3. Axonal loss - wallerian degeneration occurs
- ‼️ What is **wallerian** degeneration? What are the stages?
    - It occurs in Axonotmesis and Neurotmesis injuries (Seddon type 2 and 3) in 4 stages
    1. **Hematoma** formation - Distally, the myelin sheath degenerates and macrophages remove axonal debris
    2. **Proliferation** - Scwhann cells proliferate and migrate, forming bands of bunger
    3. **Growth Cones** - Proximal axon forms multiple axonal sprouts with growth cone at each spout
    4. **Axonal growth** = via 3 mechanisms
        - **Filopodia** - contact guidance
        - **Neurotropism** = end organ guidance
        - **Neurotrophism** = growth factors
- What are the features of progress in healing?
    - Progressive tinel sign 1mm/day (check distal to proximal)
    - Order of recovery = pain ➔ temp ➔ touch ➔ proprioception ➔ motor.
- ‼️ What is the **nerve reconstruction ladder**?
    - Nerve **repair** (only if early and tension free) [can also shorten to allow no tension] [Limit **< 2cm**] = Best is Stab wounds with sharp clean lacerations
        - Direct repair
            - Group fascicular repair = repairing the perineurium
            - Epineural repair
    - **Nerve Grafts** (if nerve defect and repair will have tension) **[> 2cm]**
        - Autograft - sural nerve (up to 20cm!), LABCN, MABCN, Saphenous nerve, Distal PIN (supplies wrist joint capsule) vein conduits
        - Allografts - collagen conduits (can be very long). (Aymeric: synthetic materials hardly used now as poor results)
    - **Nerve transfer aka Neurotization** (another nerve to nerve endings)
        
        ![Untitled](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Untitled%208.png)
        
        - In the setting of brachial plexus can be intra or extra-plexus
        - Intra-plexus
            - Oberlin Transfer – **Ulnar** nerve (branch to FCU) to MCN
            - **C7 spinal nerve** (little risk of loss of function due to redundancy. Maybe some triceps weakness) - can be ipsilateral or contralateral
        - Extra-plexus e.g.
            - **Spinal Accessory N.** (CN 11) to MCN, Suprascapular N;
            - Spinal nerves **C3/ C4**
            - **Intercostal** N ➔ MCN, phrenic
            - **Hypoglossal** nerve (CN 12)
    - **Tendon transfers**
- ‼️ What are the nerve repair principles?
    - Early
    - Match fascicles to maximise regeneration
    - Tension Free - Can shorten bone to achieve this
    - Do not over-mobilise (to avoid devascularization)
    - Minimize scarring (by using least amount of sutures)
- What are the options of nerve repair?
    - Epineural repair -  Oldest and most widely accepted technique
    - Fascicular repair i.e., repair the perineurium that covers each fascicle
    - Interfascicular repair - bundle some fascles together
    
    ![Untitled](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Untitled%209.png)
    
- Which nerve repair method is best?
    - Study by levinthal et al. 1977, study on dog peroneal nerves-  found that epineural and fasciular no difference. Interfascicular - poorer outcomes
    
    [levinthal1977.pdf](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/levinthal1977.pdf)
    
- How does nerve grafting work?
    - They act as a **conduit**, providing a scaffold for nerve to regenerate across defect.
    - Prevents mechanical block e.g. fat, blood clot from being interposed between the 2 ends
    - While allowing for nutrient exchange and accessibility of neurotrophic factors for axonal growth, providing a biologically enhanced "microenvironment' that minimize fibrosis and potential ingrowth of scar tissue
    - As a result, they reduce "axonal escape" or "misdirection" and improve regeneration into the distal nerves
    - Nerve autografts has the benefit of additional schwann cells to help in the process of nerve regeneration
- Is there a time limit to nerve grafting/ nerve transfer?
    - Limited by degeneration of motor end plates
    - Endplates degenerated by 9-12 months
    - Need to plan to do the procedure to allow time for nerve regeneration 1mm/day to be completed by 9-12 months.
- How to match fascicles?
    - At least 5 ways
    - Align **epineural features** such as the vas nervorum
    - **Cross sectional appearance** (fascicular size and position)
    - Funicular **charts**
    - Intraop **electrical stimulation**
    - **Staining**
- What factors affect nerve healing?
    - **Patient** - age, co morbid
    - **Nerve** - mechanism (sharp better vs crush/ avulsion), level (distal better), large gap
    - **Repair** - type of repair (end to end better than graft); tension free, quality of tissue (vascularity), timing (early better), infection, quality of repair (suture only epineurium and not pass needle through fascicles)
- What are the terms used to describe abnormal sensations?
    - **Paraesthesia** - spontaneous abnormal sensation
    - **Dysaesthesia** - unpleasant ABNORMAL sensation, examples of which are - Allodynia and hyperalgesia
        - **Allodynia** - pain form stimulation that does not normally cause pain
        - **Hyperalgesia** - increased response to stimulus that is not normally painful

### NEUROMAS

- SRN neuroma post op

![Untitled](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Untitled%2010.png)

- What is a neuroma?
    - Failure of growth cone regeneration to reach the peripheral target resulting in a terminal neuroma
    - Presents with sharp/ burning/ tingling pain
- ‼️ What are the types of neuromas?
    - 1. Neuroma in **continuity** - some sensation intact, tinel distally
    - 2. Neuroma **not in continuity** - complete anaesthesia, autonomic dysfunction
    - * Implication is only in the presentation. Management is still dependant on the function and if worth it to repair/ reconstruct
- What is the management of neuroma?
    - Cut neuroma proximally and bury nerve end
    - Reconstruct nerve/ tendon transfer if distally requires function

## Nerve Conduction Studies

- What is nerve conduction study?
    - Measure of sensory SNAP (sensory nerve action potential) or motor CMAP (compound motor action potential) using **supramaximal stimulation of the nerves.**
    - Via 3 parameters - **amplitude**, **latency** (time taken), **velocity** (using known distance)
    - For Motor CMAP, it is more complex (may not be applicable to CTS)
        - Because it also takes the time taken for neuromuscular transmission, muscle membrane depolarization and contraction
        - Thus, we can use another proximal stimulation point and minus each other off to find the velocity of the nerve between the 2 points
            
            ![Untitled](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Untitled%2011.png)
            
    - **Set up** - **4 electrodes** - stimulating, receiving, grounding, **reference**.
- NCS Differentiating the 3 seddon classification?
    - **Neuropraxia** = increased latency, lower velocity, amplitude normal
    - Partial **Axonotmesis** = normal latency and velocity but amplitude reduced
    - **Neurotmesis** = no conduction at all
    - However, there can be a mixed picture
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 1.37.13 PM.png](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_1.37.13_PM.png)
    
- What is supramaximal stimulation?
    - When electrically stimulating the nerves, it is **important to ensure that all the nerve fibres are fully stimulated to their maximum response**. Failure to ensure this will result in inaccurate readings.
    - It is one of the most common reasons for operator error and can lead to reduced amplitudes and prolonged latencies.
    - **Stimulus intensity is incrementally increased until a maximal amplitude is reached and then further increased by a further 20–30% to ensure this.** Typical intensities are around 30–40 milliamps.
- What is the significance of normal SNAP but loss of sensation?
    - SNAPs determine whether a nerve lesion is post-ganglionic (i.e. a peripheral neuropathy) when they are reduced or preganglionic when they are normal (i.e. radiculopathy, polio, motor neuron disease, etc. and some very exceptional neuropathic disorders).
    - The reason for this is that NCS test the circuitry of nerves up to their cell body. Because the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is the cell body of the peripheral nerves, and is located outside of the intervertebral foramina, they tend to be spared from radicular compression, even if their dorsal roots are compressed (Figure 28.10). Hence, the SNAPs will be unaffected, even though the patient is experiencing numbness.
- What are the special waves?
    - Used in assessing **proximal** nerves
    - **F-response** = seen in nerve root injuries; principle is to look for "echoes". When F-response (echo) is prolonged = injury
    - **H-reflex** = like a deep tendon reflex; so it is lost in polyneuropathy/ radiculopathy (i.e. Lower motor neuron lesion)
- What are F-waves (foot waves)? What are they used for?
    - Electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve causes depolarization in both directions (orthodromic and antidromic) (Figure 28.14). The antidromic passage of current will enter up into the anterior horn cells and irritate a small percentage of them. This causes a **secondary orthodromic response** to be generated by them down to the muscles. These are small responses which tend to be around 10% of the motor amplitude and are termed F-waves (so-called because they were first described in the feet but are also present in the hands).
    - F-waves are **not a reflex** as they only travel in the α motor fibres and **do not involve any sensory fibres.**
    - Use:
        - (1) Evaluation of **proximal** (nerve root/plexus/proximal segment) lesions of peripheral nerves.
        - (2) Early loss of these in Guillain–Barré Syndrome where **demyelination often commences in the nerve roots.**
- What is the 'H' Reflex?
    - Named eponymously after **Hoffmann** (who worked for Erb).
    - is a true reflex whereby a selective stimulation of the 1a muscle spindle **sensory** afferent fibres will activate a **monosynaptic** spinal cord reflex causing contraction of the corresponding muscle. This requires submaximal stimulation of the mixed nerve.
    - It is the neurophysiological equivalent of an ankle jerk and is only routinely studied in the **tibial nerve innervated soleus muscle**
    - Uses:
        - (1) In cases of unilateral sciatica, it helps to differentiate S1 (unilateral abnormality of soleus H reflex) from an L5 radiculopathy.
        - (2) In evaluation of demyelinating neuropathies (early loss in Guillain–Barré Syndrome).
        - (3) Demonstrating that reflexes are intact when otherwise difficult to obtain clinically, e.g. the elderly.
- ‼️ Describe NCS for **Median nerve CTS?**
    - Measuring SNAP and CMAP
    - Sensory set up - **antidromic [usually antidromic]**
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 1.42.10 PM.png](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_1.42.10_PM.png)
        
        - Stimulating proximal to wrist
        - Receiver at the fingers
        - Stimulate nerve and measure at the finger
    - Motor set up
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 1.40.26 PM.png](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_1.40.26_PM.png)
        
        - Stimulating at forearm
        - Receiver over abductor pollicis bulk
        - Stimulate and measure muscle contraction
- ‼️ What are the normal conduction velocity and amplitude?
    - Normal Reference values are usually amplitude **5mV**, Latency if **5ms**, Velocity is > **50**m/s (Rule of 5)
- What are the usual SNAP values?
    - 40-year-old, the minimal SNAP amplitudes will be 5, 10, 15 microvolts for the ulnar, median and radial responses
    - 5 and 10 microvolts for the superficial peroneal and sural SNAPs.
    - One can double these for a 20-year-old and halve these for an 80-yearold.
- What slows the velocity? implication?
    - Conduction velocities are sensitive to temperature, as cooling slows the velocities.
    - So perform at > 32 ° C
- What are orthodromic and antidromic potentials?
    - Orthodromic potentials follow the physiological route, i.e. sensory potentials towards the spinal cord and motor potentials away from the spinal cord.
    - Antidromic studies (flowing against the physiological direction) can also be performed for sensory potentials
    - In the UK, orthodromic responses are preferred in the hands as they provide the most accurate take off latencies which are important for evaluating carpal tunnel.
    - In the feet, antidromic studies are preferred as they provide the most accurate amplitudes which are important for assessing peripheral neuropathy.
- What are the other common stimulation sites?

## Electromyography (EMG) - shows progress of re-innervation

- What is EMG?
    - Assessment of Muscle activity with electrodes, looking at 2 things
    - **1. Spontaneous activity**? Normally No
    - **2. Motor Unit Action Potential (MUAP)** – size proportional to number of fibres (ask patient contract muscle)
- What is the interpretation?
    - Spontaneous activities:
        - **Normal** = no spontaneous activity
        - **Acute denervation** = Positive sharp waves
        - **Chronic denervation** = **fasciculations** - action potentials that arise spontaneously
    - Motor Unit Action Potential (MUAP)
        - **Reinnervation** = ***polyphasic*** MUAP
        - **Early reinnervation** = reduced amplitude,
        - **Late reinnervation** = larger amplitude, more consistent
- What are the EMG findings for COMPLETE nerve injury (Neurotmesis) with subseqeunt chronic denervation??
    - Very acute setting (first 2–3 weeks) of complete axonal loss
        - Spontaneous - none or positive sharp waves
        - MUAP - none
    - Thereafter,
        - spontaneous - fasciculations will appear due to **Chronic** denervation
        - MUAP - none Forever as no conduction to muscles
- What are the EMG findings for INCOMPLETE nerve injury?
    - Acute stage (first 2 weeks)
        - Spontaneous - none or positive sharp waves
        - MUAP - Remaining Axons distal to nerve injury can recruit muscle fibers. Hence MUAP present.
    - > 2 weeks - nerve regeneration
        - Spontaneous - none or positive sharp waves
        - MUAP -
            - Reinnervation leads to **polyphasic** MUAP ➔ subsequently amplitude gets larger
            - Subsequently as reinnervation progresses ➔ larger and larger MUAP
- What are the EMG findings on myopathy?
    - In myopathies, the muscle fibres shrink (atrophy), leading to small-amplitude MUAPs.
    - Should not have spontaneous activity as there is no denervation
        - But, Fibrillations/positive sharp waves/complex repetitive discharges may also be present and are a sign of active inflammation, i.e. myositis.

## Spine Monitoring

- How do you monitor the spine intraop?
    - 3 things - SSEP, MEP, EMG
- What is SSEP?
    - Monitoring of **DCML** (more posterior)
    - Continuous stimulation of peripheral nerves, transcranial monitoring somatosensory cortex receiving
    - Electrodes attach to lower extremity, stimulating **posterior tibial nerve** behind ankle, **ulnar nerve** in upper extremity
    - Use of control areas - Supraclavicular area (Cervical op C4), Popliteal fossa (lumbar spine op S2) - to exclude technical errors
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 1.12.46 PM.png](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_1.12.46_PM.png)
    
- What is MEP?
    - Monitoring of the Corticospinal tract (more anterior)
    - Stimulate cortex, receive peripherally e.g. **EHL or soleus** for lumbar spine
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 1.12.46 PM.png](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_1.12.46_PM.png)
    
- Which is more accurate?
    - Both have pros and cons
    - SSEP - Less affected by anaesthesia BUT not reliable in detecting ischemic injury
    - MEP - Effective at detecting ischemic injury (loss of anterior spinal artery in anterior 2/3 of cord)
- What factors affect SSEP and MEP?
    - **Anaesthetist** - Paralyics affect MEP, inhalationals affect SSEP. So use **TIVA (Total intravenous anaesthesia**.; Depth of anaesthesia; BP and Oxygenation
    - **Surgeon** factors – large deformity correction, positioning, retractor placement
    - **System** error – poor placement of electrodes
- ‼️ What to do if drop in signal?
    - **Surgeon** – stop manipulation, release traction, warm saline, look for implant malposition
    - **Anaesthetist** – Check what drug given, lighten anesthesia, increase BP, check electrolytes
    - **Neurophysiologist** – repeat trials of MEP, increase stimulus strength
    - **OTT -** reduce noise and electrical interference
    - IF NO IMPROVEMENT ➔ consider Stagnara Wake Up test/ aborting surgery
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 1.17.58 PM.png](11%20Nerves%20NCS%20EMG%20f3f5c21a95074ee9bb5f07583c2f9a43/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_1.17.58_PM.png)
    
- How does EMG monitoring work?
    - Tests **nerve root,** good for **lumbar spine surgery** where spinal cord ended
    - 2 Types of EMG
        - **Free running** EMG (spontaneous)
            - Microtrauma to nerve root induces depolarization is recorded.
            - Can be triggered by mechanical stimulation like instruments
        - **Triggered** EMG
            - Concept is that bone conducts electricity poorly
            - So surgeon can stimulate the screw. If depolarization is detected = bone breech
- What muscles do you use for EMG monitoring?
