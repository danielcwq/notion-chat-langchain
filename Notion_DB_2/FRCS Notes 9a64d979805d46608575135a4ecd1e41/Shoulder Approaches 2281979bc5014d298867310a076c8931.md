### **Anterior deltopectoral**

- **Internervous** – axillary and lateral pec nerve
- **Danger** (4) – 1Msc nerve, 2axillary nerve, 3anterior humeral circumflex artery, 4Brachial plexus
- P - Beach Chair
- I – Coracoid down deltopectoral groove
- D – delto pect fascia retract cephalic vein **laterally** (Reason: tributaries come from the lateral side) ➔ identify coracoid process and conjoint tendon ➔ incise **clavipectoral fascia** lateral to conjoint (protect Msc. Nerve, avoid over medial retraction) ➔ Down to subscap ➔ identify 3 sisters (Anterior humeral circumflex and 2 venae comittantes) **[Lower limit of incision]** ; ligate them ➔ Incise subscap in ER position, **adduct** arm (protect BP) and do not go beyond that (axillary nerve) ➔ Joint capsule

- E – anterolateral OR Anterior approach to humerus
- Why is the landmark for the 3 sisters important?
    - Posterior circumflex humeral artery goes thru quadrilateral space.
    - Upper margin of quadrilateral space is the lower margin of the subscapularis. Thats why the 3 sisters is very important land mark.
- How to improve visualization?
    - KIV coracoid osteotomy. Drill and tap before ostotomy.
- What attaches to coracoid process? What is in the conjoint tendon?
    - 3 tendons - pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and short head of the biceps brachii muscles
    - 4, ligaments coracoclavicular, coracohumeral, coracoacromial ligaments, transverse scapular ligament
- Where does the musculocutaneous nerve enter the coracobrachialis?
    - 5-8cm distal to coracoid process
- ‼️ What if perfuse bleeding?
    - Likely the anterior circumflex artery is injured
    - I will need to extend proximally, may need a **midclavicle** osteotomy to assess the axillary artery

### Deltoid Split Approach (Mckenzie Approach)

- D – Axillary nerve
- I – 5cm longitudinal from tip of acromion down lateral arm
- D – split deltoid muscle – avoid > 5cm to protect axillary nerve ➔ reach the Supraspinatus attachment and GT

### **Posterior Judet Approach**

- InterN plane – Infraspinatous (SS nerve) and Teres minor (axillary)
- D (2) – SS nerve in suprascapular notch, axillary nerve and posterior circumflex artery in quadrangular space
- P – lateral
- I – along scapular spine and curved inferior medially
- D – expose and sharp dissect **deltoid** off scapular spine ➔ Identify ISP (superior) and TM (inferior) ➔ retract TM inferiorly together with the quadrangular and triangular space away ➔ joint capsule

### Shoulder Arthroscopy

- P – Beach chair, aware of padding, face padding, slow inclination
- Portals
    - Posterior - 2cm inferior and medially to posterior corner of acromion; aim towards Coracoid process
        - Plane is within **INFRASPINATUS**
    - Anterior portal just above subscap in rotator interval,
    - Superior portal
- What layers do you go through?
    - Skin, subcut, **DELTOID**, Subdeltoid BURSA, **INFRASPINATUS**, joint capsule

- ‼️ What is the rotator Interval?
    - Medially by Lateral **coracoid base**, Superiorly by inferior edge of **supraspinatus**, inferiorly by the superior border of the **subscapularis**
    - Contents = biceps tendon, **CHL**, **SGHL**

### Clavicle Anterior Approach

- P - supine, sand bag between medial border of scapula and spine
- I - Along the subcutaneous clavicle
- D - Skin, fascia, platysma muscle, try to preserve supraclavicluar nerves
