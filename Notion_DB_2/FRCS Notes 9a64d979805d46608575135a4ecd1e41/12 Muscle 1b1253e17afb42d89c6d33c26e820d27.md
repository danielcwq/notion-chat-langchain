- ‼️ What is the macro structure of muscle?
    - Sarcomeres ➔ Myofibrils ➔ Muscle fibres ➔ Fascicles (10-100 muscle fibres) ➔ muscle
    - Coverings: **Endomysium** (covers each muscle fibre) ➔ **Perimysium** (covers fasciles) ➔ **Epimysium** (covers the muscle)

- ‼️ ⚠️ Describe the process of muscle contraction?
    - This occurs in 5 steps (aka Cross Bridge Cycle aka Sliding Filament Theory)
    - 1. **Depolarization** - Acetylcholine released at end plate, causing depolarization
        
        ![Untitled](12%20Muscle%201b1253e17afb42d89c6d33c26e820d27/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - 2. **Calcium** release by Sarcoplasmic retinaculum
        
        ![Untitled](12%20Muscle%201b1253e17afb42d89c6d33c26e820d27/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - 3. Binding of calcium to **Troponin Complex** to expose myosin binding site on the Actin–
        - At rest, myosin binding site on action is blocked by Tropomyosin
        - When Calcium binds to Troponin Complex, **tropomyosin** moves and exposes myosin binding site
            
            ![Untitled](12%20Muscle%201b1253e17afb42d89c6d33c26e820d27/Untitled%204.png)
            
    - 4. **Myosin S1 head engages with actin** by **racheting** and **cross bridging** and **contracts = POWER STROKE** [aka Sliding Filament Theory]
    - 5. S1 head disengages via ATP dependant mechanism and moves to next binding site

- ‼️ Draw the microstructure of muscle i.e. sarcomere?
    - Seen on an electron micrograph
    - Striations alternating light and dark bands
    - Consists of Thick myosin bands and Thin Actin Bands
    - AHM, IZ
        - Remember as Anisotropic, Heller, Myosin
        - Isotropic, Zwischen
    - Need to remember the AH (Heller)M and IZ zones with the M and Z (Ming Zhou) being the Lines and the rest being zones
    - A sarcomere unit is defined as between 2 Z (Zwischen) lines

- ‼️ What is isotropic and Anisotropic in the sarcomere electromicrograph?
    - As the I bands are **uniform** (iso = same/uniform) in appearance throughout they are called isotropic bands.
    - The dark A bands are not uniform as they have both thick and thin filaments and are therefore called anisotropic.
- ‼️ DRAW - What is the Tension-Length relationship of muscle? What law?
    - **Frank Starling Curve**
    - Force generated directly related to degree of overlap between Actin and Myosin
    - Optimal length = Resting length
    - Long lengths ➔ less cross bridge ➔ force drop
    - Short lengths ➔ cannot slide past each other ➔ force drops (**Law of Von Schwann)**
        
        ![Untitled](12%20Muscle%201b1253e17afb42d89c6d33c26e820d27/Untitled%208.png)
        
- What is the Law of Von Schwann?
    - States that muscle tension diminishes as its muscle fibres shorten ➔ explained with Frank Starling curve
- What is the Frank Starling Law?
    - Opposite of the law of Von scwhann
    - States that the greater the initial length of sarcomere, greater the force of contraction
- What is force and speed dependant on?
    - **Force** = proportionate to Cross Sectional Area and Extent of overlap between actin and myosin ➔ described by the length tension curve
    - **Speed** = proportionate to the length tension relationship of the muscle. too short, too long will be slow.
- What is the issue in myasthenia Gravis?
    - Issue is presence of **acetylcholine receptor antibodies** competing with the real acetylcholine, prevent depolarisation

- ‼️ How does Botox work in the use for spasticity?
    - Works by blocking **pre-synaptic acetylcholine release**
        
        ![Untitled](12%20Muscle%201b1253e17afb42d89c6d33c26e820d27/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- How does Baclofen work in the use for spasticity?
    - It is a GABA **agonist,**  which acts both centrally and peripherally to reduce spasticity
- Types of muscle fibres?
    - Can be divided into:
    - Shape
        
        ![Untitled](12%20Muscle%201b1253e17afb42d89c6d33c26e820d27/Untitled%2011.png)
        
        - Parallel - parallel to line of pull
            - Strap - (sartorius, rectus femoris)
            - Fan-shaped/ convergent - triangular (Pec major)
            - Fusiform (biceps)
        - Pennate - short muscle fibers oblique to line of pull
            - Unipennate - insert only one side of tendon (FPL)
            - Bipennate - insert on 2 sides of a tendon (rectus femoris)
            - Multipennate - series of bipennate muscles in one plane (deltoid)
        - Circular - fascicles arranged in a concentric ring (e.g. Obicularis oris)
    - ‼️ Type of oxidation
        - **Type 1** = Slow twitch, Red, oxidative (endurance)
        - **Type 2A** = **Fast** twitch, **oxidative** glycolytic (i.e. aerobic)
        - **Type 2B** = glycolytic (i.e. **anaerobic**)
- Types of Contraction and training?
    - **Isotonic** = same muscle tension throughout e.g. biceps curl
        - **Eccentric** = contract in lengthening
        - **Concentric** = contract in shortening
    - **Isometric (opposite to isotonic)** = same length. E.g. static planking
    - **Isokinetic** = 4 features - increasing tension as muscle contracts as joints go through FROM at constant velocity
- Types of Exercises?
    - **Closed** kinetic chain (CKC) = distal segment fixed = less joint shear forces
    - **Open** kinetic chain (OKC) = distal segment mobile = more joint reaction forces
    - Clinical application?
        - Traditionally understood that open chain exercises place greater strain on the ACL and the PFJ
        - So usually reserved to later in the rehabilitation phase
        - However, recent studies and meta-analysis shows no difference. [https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2018.7656](https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2018.7656)
- Where does injury commonly occur? How do they heal
    - Commonly occurs at the **myotendinous** junction during high velocity eccentric contraction
    - Heals by scaring
- How does ligamentotaxis work?
    - When ligaments are relaxed, they have crimp
    - After stretching them, till the elastic zone, they can then aid in reduction as a tension band
- Do muscles relax when you apply traction?
    - No, initially they respond with contraction
    - Monosynaptic reflex, meaning it goes to the spinal cord at the same level and return to cause contraction of the muscle
- How does traction before reduction work?
    - When one pulls the muscle, it contracts due to stretch reflex
    - However, this traction persistently stimulates the Golgi tendon organs in the muscles
    - This leads to the **golgi tendon stretch reflex aka inverse stretch reflex** occurs, causing relaxation
