## P - Tibial Eminence Fracture

![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled.png)

- Why does this happen in children?
    - Hyperextension injury
    - In children bone is weaker than ligament ➔ ACL avulsion
- Invx?
    - MRI to look for associated injuries
    - Matthias et al. 37% a/w meniscal injuries (mostly 90% Lateral)
- Classification of Tibial eminence fractures?
    - Meyer and Mckeever (like Gartland)

    - Type 1 = undisplaced
    - 2 = displaced with intact posterior hinge
    - 3 = Posterior hinge disrupted
    - Modified type 4 = **Comminuted**
- Management?
    - 1 and 2 = if able to reduce ➔ immobilise in extension for 4 week
    - Type 3 = ORIF open vs arthroscopic assisted
        - Suture OR
        - Screw fixation
- What is preventing reduction?
    - Initially thought to be soft tissue **interposition** by anterior horn of LM and inter meniscal ligament but recent studies show that it is not
    - Instead, due to anterior horn of lateral meniscus attached to same fragment, pulling in different directions).
        - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12429751/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12429751/)
        - Lowe et al. JBJS 2002 arthroscopic observe actions after failed closed reduction

## P - Tibial Tuberosity Fracture

- What are the ossification centers near the knee?
    - 2 ossification centers at proximal tibia
    - 1° at tibia plateau
    - 2° at the tibia tuberosity
- Why do these injuries occur? What age group?
    - Tibial tuberosity only develops from a secondary ossification center between 10-12 year old!
    - Because the direction of physeal closure is from proximal to distal, this makes the tibial tuberosity more vulnerable to fracture in the adolescent (ala transitional fractures).
    - It only fuses by 15-17 years old!
    - So this injury occurs at 12-17 years old!!
- ‼️ Key clinical assessment??
    - **Anterior tibia recurrent artery** prone to be injured = 20% compartment syndrome! (**Frey** et al. 2008 JPO in 20 patients, 4 had compartment syndrome)
- ‼️ What is the classification of tibial tuberosity Fracture?

    - Watson Jones Classification, modified by Ogden; Modified with A (undisplaced) and B (displaced)
    - Type 1 = # through 2° ossification centre
    - 2 = # between 1° and 2° centers
    - 3 = # through 1° center **(intra-articular)**
    - 4 = Through **entire proximal physis**
    - 5 = **apophyseal avulsion** of tibia tuberosity
- How do you fix this?
    - Use 4mm partially threaded canulated screws
    - I will hyperextend the knee by putting a bolster under the calf
    - Direct longitudinal incision over fracture, remove interposed perosteum, reduce and pass guidewires from Anterior to posterior while avoiding the physis,
    - Post op flex the knee to 90 ° to screen
- What potential complication?
    - **Recurvatum** (growth arrest of secondary ossification center) ➔ Do epiphysiodesis to complete growth shut down KIV corrective opening wedge osteotomy

## Cozen’s Fracture

![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%204.png)

- What is cozen's fracture?
    - Proximal tibia Metaphyseal Fracture
- What is the classic MOI?
    - Typically low-energy with valgus force across the knee creating incomplete fracture of proximal tibia
    - Can also result from torsional injury
    - Classic mechanism is a child going down a slide in the lap of an adult with leg extended
- What is cozen's Phenomenon?
    - It is the phenomenon whereby valgus deformity progresses **rapidly** in the first year
    - Reaching max deformity before spontaneously correcting over next few years
- Parent ask what will come of this fracture?
    - Explain **50% of patients will develop valgus** deformity
    - All of which should self correct
    - [Yvonne-Mary Papamerkouriou et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32582389/) JPO 2020 study of 33 patients ➔ 50% develop valgus ➔ all self corrected
- Is it associated with LLD?
    - Usually a/w **lengthening of 1cm**

## Toddler’s Fracture

![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%205.png)

- What is toddler fracture?
    - Spiral # of tibial In young **ambulatory** children (1-4 years old)
- What is the common MOI?
    - MOI: Seemingly harmless twist or fall
- What fracture configuration may make you suspect NAI?
    - Transverse tibial # suspect NAI! And less than 1 year non ambulatory child
- Clinical presentation?
    - Refusal to wt bear, walk with limp (Do not diagnosis transient synovitis till > 4 years old)
- Management?
    - Immobilised in above knee cast for 3/52

## Tibial Shaft Fractures

- Mx = Non op vs Op
    - Non op with full cast
- Relative indications for surgery?
    - Relative indications for op = segmental, floating knees, open #, large obese children, poor alignment
- Surgical technique?
    - TENS Nail + Back slab ➔ Convert to cast in clinic
    - [TENS Nail Principles](https://www.notion.so/TENS-Nail-Principles-e917c0ec42e441f59c85a5712004c51b)
- Is there weight limitation for Tibia flexible nail like femur nail?
    - No
    - [Goodbody et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25887826/) found no sig difference between weight >50kg (as compared to femur shaft) for titanium nails

## Transitional Fractures

- What is a Triplane fracture?
    
    ![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - "L2, AP3, Total 4"
    - SH4 injury with a SH2 appearance on lateral view and SH3 on AP view
- What is a Tillaux Fracture?
    
    ![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - SH 3 injury due to ATFL avulsion
- ‼️ Why do these transitional fractures occur?
    
    ![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - Physeal closure sequence: **Central** (12.5yo) ➔ **Posteromedial** (13) ➔ posterior (13.5) ➔ anterolateral (14yo)
- Which injury occur in older patients?
    - Tillaux fracture. Occurs at 12-14 year old
- What investigation will you order?
    - CT scan to evaluate displacement
    
    ![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%209.png)
    

- ‼️ What is the management of transitional fractures?
    - Depends on displacement
    - **< 2mm displaced = Conservative**
        - [Rapariz et al. JPO 1996.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8747367/) 35 patients with triplane. < 2mm displacement, prognosis good. > 2mm degenerative changes seen.
    - **> 2mm displaced = Op**
        - 2 screw techniques OR CRPP technique with casting (no difference)
- Surgical Approach?
    - **Tillaux** = **Anterolateral** mini arthrotomy. Along 4th MT, protect SPN, wash and fix with 3.5-4.5mm screw.
    - **Triplane** = **Anterior** Approach
        - AP screw for metaphyseal fragment
        - LM screw for epiphyseal fragment (or even ML screw)
        
        ![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%2010.png)

- Complications?
    - Physeal arrest with angular deformity

### Medial Distal Tibia Physeal injury

![Untitled](P%20Tibia%20Fractures%20987ec27b0a1c44109ba27e6e5906cd21/Untitled%2011.png)

- How will you manage?
    - This is likely difficult to reduce as there is periosteum interposed in the fracture site
    - I will have a low threshold to bring into theatre for open reduction and fixation
- What approach will you use?
    - Anteromedial approach (medial to AT)

## P - Fibula Physeal Fracture

- ‼️ At what age do these occur?
    - Distal fibula physis closes about **19-20yo**, so Usually occur older than Tillaux since distal tibia close at 14 yo!
    - Some authors call it “reverse-Tillaux”
    - Almost like a weber B type of injury
- If XR normal, should I do MRI?
    - **JAMA 2016 Boutis et al.** Prospective study of 271 ankle injuries ➔ XR -ve for distal fibula # ➔ MRI found 3% occult SH1 injury
    - Children with MRI-detectable-only **SH1 injuries similar recovery if treated as sprain with removable ankle brace** and self regulated return to activities.
- Management
    - Undisplaced = Non Op
    - Displaced = Op
        - Closed reduction with smotth wire
        - If unable to close reduce ➔ ORIF with physeal sparing plate fixation
    - KIV syndesmotic fixation
