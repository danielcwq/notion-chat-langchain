### Varus Knee

*[Causes:]
Blounts (Idiopathic)
**T**rauma - Distal Femur
**I**nfection with bar
**T**umor - Osteochondroma, Enchondroma
Congenital - Achondroplasia
Metabolic - Rickets*

- [Stand and Look]
    - From front -
        - “obvious varus deformity of the lower limb with **widened intercondylar distance**(do not say knee before cover test)
        - **Bilateral vs Unilateral varus?**
        - “Sir I note bilateral/ unilateral genu varus with widened intercondylar distance.”
            - UNILATERAL - “This may be due to a unilateral pathology or a systemic pathology with unilateral manifestation” - go on to examine for the cause and complications
            - BILATERAL - “This may be idiopathic or pathological i would want to go on to examine to elicit the cause and complications”
        - Look for **syndromic** features
            - **Achondroplasia** - frontal bossing, maxillary hypoplasia, flattened nose bridge
            - **Rickets** - frontal bossing; chest for pectus carinatum or excavatum
            - Short stature?
        - No scars for previous trauma/ surgeries around knee
        - Sides - sagittal alignment
            - No kyphosis (rickets)
        - Back - coronal alignment
            - No scoliosis
- [WALK]
    - Look at gait for **varus thrust**
- [LIE DOWN]
    - Feel - no **lumps** (osteochondroma)
    - Evaluate knee - ligaments, correctibility, pain, ROM
    - **[Unilateral]** Evaluate limb length - can be shortened with trauma
    - Neurovascular - foot drop, DP
- Complete my exam by
    - Charting the child’s height and weight to look for short stature
    - XR long film to evaluate mechanical alignments and Chart Tibiofemoral angles on Salenius curve
    - History from parents and child
    - Clinical symptoms - pain and dysfunction

### Uni or Bilateral Valgus Knee - think Patellar Instability

*[Causes:]
Dysplasia - MED, SED
Developmental - Fibula Hemimelia, PFFD
**T**rauma - Distal Femur, Cozen
**I**nfection 
**T**umor - Osteochondroma, Enchondroma
Metabolic - RIckets
Idiopathic*

- [Stand and Look]
    - From front
        - “Sir I note bilateral genu valgus with widened intermalleolar distance.”
            - UNILATERAL - “This may be due to a unilateral pathology or a systemic pathology with unilateral manifestation” - go on to examine for the cause and complications
            - BILATERAL - “This may be idiopathic or pathological i would want to go on to examine to elicit the cause and complications”
            - No scars in distal femur proximal tibia, proximal hip
            - Does not look to have short stature but i would like to plot on a growth chart, no features of frontal bossing to suggest rickets
            - No obvious tibia shortening/ bowing/ missing lateral rays to suggest fibula hemimelia
        - Valgus knees with **widened intermalleolar distance**
        - Scars - to suggest previous surgery
        - Lumps - **osteochondroma! Very commonly come out**
        - Look for syndromic features
            - Rickets
            - Fibula hemimelia - missing toes, UL deformities (ulnar club hands)
    - From side
        - No sagittal malalignment to suggest SED
    - From back
        - No scoliosis - SED
- [WALK]
    - Gait - looking for trendlenberg gait (MED, SED, PFFD), walking aids
    - Gait unilateral trendelenberg gait
        - Congenital short femur
    - Trendelenberg test - “Not positive to suggest pathology in the proximal femur”
- [SIT]
    - Evaluate J-sign.
- [LIE DOWN]
    - Evaluate knee ligaments
        - ACL (absent ACL in hemimelia, CFFD)
        - Collaterals (LCL correctibility)
    - Measure limb length to look for LLD (Congenital short femur, fibula hemimelia, lengthening on Cozen)
    - Evaluate for miserable mal-alignment syndrome. Do rotational assessments
- Complete exam by
    - Beighton score
    - History - PMHx, symptoms and function

### Unilateral Valgus Knee

    - Look for aids and heel raises
    - Come back for **trendelenberg test**
- [Lie down]

        - Square pelvis - measure true limb length
        - Galeazzi test for femur vs tibia shortening
        - Digital bryant’s triangle test
    - **Knee** laxity for association in PFFD - Lachmann, ACL

- Complete my examination
    - History for TIT, congenital conditions
- Possible scenarios
    - **Shortening at femur**

    - **Shortening at tibia**
        - Previous fractures
        - Tumor - MHE
        - Fibula/ tibial hemimelia

### Limb Length Discrepancy - [Hemihypertrophy]

- [Stand and Look]
    - From front
        - Obvious LLD with hypertrophy of one limb - bigger in circumference and length
        - Look for features of non idiopathic hemihypertrophy

            [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2bxODibvb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2bxODibvb0)
            
        - Toe gait, equinus contracture
        - Circumduction on the long limb
    - Look for aids and heel raises
- [Lie down]
    - **LLD assessment:**
        - When lying down naturally - measure apparent limb length from midline structure
        - Square pelvis - measure true limb length
        - Galeazzi test for femur vs tibia shortening
        - Digital bryant’s triangle test
- Complete my examination
    - **Abdominal** exam - for Wilm’s tumor (kidney tumor)
    - History from parents and child

[Limb Length Discrepancy (LLD), Hemihypertrophy and associated Syndromes](Limb%20Length%20Discrepancy%20(LLD),%20Hemihypertrophy%20and%209c6b92d367c84e3f8a93733b68a2915f.md) 

### Klippel Feil and Sprengel

- **look**: identify the asymmetry in the shoulder, low hair line
- **feel**: Shoulder and Cervical spine
- Shoulder
    - ROM - can stand behind to comment on Scapulothoracic rhythmn (no movement on scapula)
- cervical spine movement - expect limited
- Offer to look for associated conditions.
    - VACTERL - cardiac examination
    - 

### **Torticollis approach**

- Patient sitting - look from front and back
    - “This patient has torticolis, will go on to elicit the cause of it”
    - Comment on side of the tilt - chin is towards the right/ left
    - Anterior - dysmorphic features, facial asymmetry
    - Posterior for KFS features - low hair line, short webbed neck, stiff ROM
    - Check mouth for pharyngitis
    - check eyes - do H movement - “there is no ocular squint”
    - Auditory - i do not see any hearing aids that suggest auricular cause
- **Move**
    - Patient has restricted ROM due to this deformity
- Ask “Is there any pain” - this will open up pain vs painless torticollis - likely no pain
- **feel**
    - Palpate SCM (fibrous nodule) - mention that the SCM is tight on the right with chin pointing to the left, supporting diagnosis of a CMT and not AARD which is opposite
    - Cervical spine - confirm no tenderness  (AARD)
- Look for **associated features with CMT**
    - Packaging disorders set - Plagiocephaly, tibial PM bowing, tibia internal torsion, metatarsus adductus,
- Complete my exam with full neurological exam
