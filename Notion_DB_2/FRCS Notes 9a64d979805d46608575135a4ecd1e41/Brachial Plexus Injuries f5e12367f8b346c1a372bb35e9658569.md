## BPI Introduction

- Picture of clawed Hand. What is this?
    
    ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled.png)
    
    - Clawed hand, intrinsic minus position
    - Concerns of Lower root brachial plexus palsy
    - Ddx = Volkmann's ischemic contractures. Confirm diagnosis, etiology, extent, pre or post ganglionic, with triple assessment. PE - tenodesis, sensation,
- Can you draw the Brachial plexus?
    
    ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - Dorsoscapular nerve - Rhomboid muscles, levator scapulae
    - Long thoracic nerve - serratus anterior
    - Suprascpular nerve - Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus
    - Subclavian nerve - subclavius muscle
    - Inferior subscapular nerve - subscapularis, teres major
    - Superior Subscapular nerve - Subscapularis muscle
    - Thoracodorsal nerve - Latissimus Dorsi
    - ***Trapezius and SCM** is by CN 11 nerve. (spinal Accessory nerve)
- What is the anatomy of Brachial plexus in relation to the clavicle and muscles?
    - Roots - between scalenus anterior and medius
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Trunks - Posterior triangle of neck
    - **Divisions** - Behind clavicle ➔ No branches
    - Cords - Medial, lateral and posterior in reference to the Axillary artery!
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Branches
- What are clues to the level on inspection only?
    - **Partial:**
        - **Erb’s** = Upper C5/6 = loss of elbow flexion and wrist extension ➔ Waiter's tip
        - **Klumpke** = Lower C8/ T1 = loss of intrinsic muscles of hand ➔ clawed hand. [Aymeric: VERY rare. Only seen 3 in 20 years]
    - **Complete:** global wasting with claw hands!
- How do you determine pre or post ganglionic?
    - I can determine based on **3 things** - clinical findings, MRI, Neurotesting
        - 1. Clinically
            - Assess **muscles** that arises from roots (3)
            - Assess **sympathetic** involvement
                - Horner's Syndrome [Loss of sympathetics] - miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis
                - UL - Histamine test, sweat test, skin wrinkling test [presence of sympathetic response]
        - 2. Imaging - MRI and CXR
            - **CXR** - raised hemidiaphragm
            - Cervical XR - transverse process fractures
            - MRI - myelomeningoceles, empty root nerve sheath
        - 3. NCS/ EMG
            - Both sensory loss, but Post ganglionic, SNAP is not present (due to injury proximal to cell bodies). In Preganglionic, SNAP is present
            - EMG - cervical paraspinal muscles intact in Pre-ganglionic
    
    [https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)
    
- How can history help?
    - Extent of pain - Severe neuropathic pain in preganglionic lesions
- What bedside tests can you do to assess autonomic function?
    - **Histamine** Test
        - Done by applying 1% of histamine solution on skin to the specific dermatone
            
            ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%204.png)
            
        - Preganglionic lesions preserves the **autonomic nerves** that arises from the sympathetic chain. Thus, a positive response to histamine test is seen in preganglionic lesions.
        - **3 features** - wheal, flare and redness
        - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214751919302762](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214751919302762)Pre-ganglionic lesions preserve the integrity of the network of free [nerve endings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nerve-ending) in the skin, because they are supplied by neurons located in the paravertebral sympathetic chain. On the other hand, in post-ganglionic lesions, there is distal degeneration of small [autonomic nerve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/autonomic-nerve) fibers, which leads to skin neurovegetative denervation. This results in absence of secondary neurogenic erythema during the histamine test.
    - **Sweat** Test
        - Dusting skin with starch and iodine shows up the wet areas as feep purple
        - Also a test of autonomic function - sympathetic unmyelinated fibres
    - **Skin wrinkling** test
        - Wrinkling of the skin of the palm and sole is considered to be dependent on the presence of intact **sympathetic** nervous activity
        - If skin wrinkles, then it is pre-ganglionic
            
            ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%205.png)
            
    - ** Opposite from horner’s syndrome. Horner present because Sympathetic chain is disrupted in the face. UL sympathetic present because not disrupted
- What XR do you want? XR Features?
    - XR - transverse process fracture
    - Chest XR - hemidiaphragm paralysis
- MRI scan?
    - Traumatic pseudomeningoceles
    - Cord shifts from midline
    - Empty nerve root sheath
- Nerve conduction studies?
    
    ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - In Pre-ganglionic, SNAP is intact (BUT SENSATION IS LOST) but CMAP is lost. Because the cell body of sensory nerve is in the ganglion.
    - In Post ganglionic, both absent
- EMG studies?
    - Cervical paraspinal muscles denervated in preganglionic but still innervated in post ganglion
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%207.png)
        
- **When will you do the investigations?**
    - I will do them 3 weeks after injury
    - This will provide time for nerve to degenerate (wallerian) so that they will be positive.
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%208.png)
        
- What is the gold standard to determine pre or post ganglionic?
    - The best way to ascertain whether root avulsion has occurred is by means of direct inspection through cervical laminectomy.
- ‼️ How to classify Brachial plexus Injuries?
    - **Leffert Classification**
    - Type 1 = Open
    - Type 2 = Closed
        - 2a = supraclavicular
        - 2b = infraclavicular - usually involves branches from the trunks
    - 3 = **Radiation** induced
    - 4 = Obsetric
        - 4a = Erb’s
        - 4b = Klumpke
- What are the poor prognostic factors of BPI?
    - **Patient** - elderly, comorbids
    - **Injury** factors - pre ganglionic, pan plexus, high energy, flaccid paralysis of entire limb, painful anesthetic limbs

## Management of BPI

- What is the **timing** of surgical intervention?
    - Controversial!
    - If **open injury (Leffert 1)** = immediate surgery
    - **Pre-ganglionic** avulsions - **consensus is early** 4-6 weeks. Not immediate to allow time for demarcation
    - **Post ganglionic** = no consensus but a trend towards earlier intervention.
        - Because of the desire to strike a balance between spontaneous reinnervation and risk of end plate death
        - Baseline EMG, NCS at 4/52
        - Serial studies to monitor recovery
        - Traditional approach is Exploration at 3-6 months if no progress
        - If BP is in continuity ➔ neurolysis
        - If not, Reconstruct ➔ nerve grafts/ transfers
- ‼️ What are the features of reinnervation?
    - Deep muscle pain - squeeze muscle to see if elicit pain e.g. biceps. If pain = reinnervation
    - Tinel sign (percuss distal to proximal)
- What are the treatment goals?
    - 1st priority - **Elbow** flexion
    - 2nd – **shoulder** control with abduction, ER and scapular stabilization.
    - 3rd - **Wrist** prehension
- ‼️ What is the **nerve reconstruction ladder**?
    - Nerve **repair** (only if early and tension free) [can also shorten to allow no tension] [Limit **< 2cm**] = Best is Stab wounds with sharp clean lacerations
        - Direct repair
        - Peri-epineural/ fascicular repair
    - **Nerve Grafts** (if nerve defect and repair will have tension) **[> 2cm]**
        - Autograft - sural nerve (up to 20cm!), LABCN, MABCN, Saphenous nerve, Distal PIN (supplies wrist joint capsule) vein conduits
        - Allografts - collagen conduits (can be very long). (Aymeric: synthetic materials hardly used now as poor results)
    - **Nerve transfer aka Neurotization**(another nerve to nerve endings)
        - In the setting of brachial plexus can be intra or extra-plexus
        - Intra-plexus
            - Oberlin Transfer – **Ulnar** nerve (branch to FCU) to MCN
            - **C7 spinal nerve** (little risk of loss of function due to redundancy. Maybe some triceps weakness) - can be ipsilateral or contralateral
        - Extra-plexus e.g.
            - **Spinal Accessory N.** (CN 11) to MCN, Suprascapular N;
            - Spinal nerves **C3/ C4**
            - **Intercostal** N ➔ MCN, phrenic
            - Hypoglossal nerve (CN 12)
    - **Tendon transfers**
    - **Fusion**
- Which Nerve transfers (more commonly done now as better outcomes than nerve grafting) for which joint?
    - **Shoulder** - SAN [Pure Motor], Suprascapular, Phrenic nerve [Pure motor]
    - **Elbow Flexion** (c5) - Oberlin or intercostals
    - Hand (C8/T1) - Median nerve or C5 or contralateral C7 root
- Management of Neurologic pain?
    - **Intercostal nerve transfers** can be done for the sole purpose of pain relief.
- What are the common tendon transfers used in BPI?
    - Shoulder external rotation
        - Trapezius (SAN) to deltoid transfer
        - **Lat Dorsi (TD)** for ER
        - Anterior transfer of posterior deltoid
    - Elbow flexion options
        - **Steindler** flexoplasty - transfer of the common origin of flexor tendon more proximal
        - **Lat Dorsi** (if there is partial recovery of C5)
        - Transfer of pec major
        - Transfer of triceps tendon to biceps
        - DOI transfer - the use of **gracilis**
- ⚠️ Do you know a classic **Functional Free Muscle Transplantation (FFMT)** used in Brachial plexus injury?
    - **Doi** 2 stage reconstruction
        - **Stage 1** = Transfer of 1st gracillis to restore **elbow** flexion and **wrist** extension (**SAN** neurotization)
        - **Stage 2** = Transfer of 2nd gracillis to restore **finger flexion** (**Intercostal** nerves neurotization)

- What are the types of TOS?
    - **Neurogenic** 90% due to entrapment of BP (80% is lower roots, 20% is upper roots)
    - Vascular is uncommon
- What is a clinical test you can do?
    - **[Nerologic] Roo’s test** – Surrender position for 3 min while open/ close hands - feel nump
    - [**Vascular**] **Adson’s test -**
        - Patient siting, arm abducted 30 ° and elbow extended; palpate radial pulse
        - Ask patient to extend neck and turn head **towards** symptomatic shoulder, take a deep breath and hold
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%209.png)
        
- Management?
    - Remove source of compression if surgically indicated

## OBSTETRIC BPI

![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%2010.png)

- What differentials?
    - Arthrogryposis with tubular arms
- Risk factors for Obstetric BPI?
    - Large babies, maternal DM, long labor, forceps delivery
    - **Strongest predictor** is birth weight > 4500gm (but inability to accurately predict birth weight before delivery limits its use for selecting for C-section)
- ‼️ Classification for obstetric BPI?
    - **Narakas**
        - Group 1 = C5/6 (incomplete)
        - Group 2 = C5 -C7 (
        - Group 3 = flail (some finger flexion) (complete)
        - Group 4 = flail with **Horner’s = Preganglionic**
- How will you clinically assess?
    - **3 reflexes:**
        - 1. Moro’s aka startle reflex
            - **Supine** infant, raise head 30 ° from cot and drop it to level surface while supporting it.
            - Hands open and arms are briskly extended and abducted followed by flexion, adduction and hand closure
            - Look for symmetricity.
        - 2. Grasp reflex - touch hand and it will wrap fingers around yours.
        - 3. Asymmetric tonic neck reflex aka fencing reflex - turn the head, will go into archer (elbow flexion)
            
            ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%2011.png)
            
    - **Horner’s** - pre-ganglionic = group 4
    - Look for associated injuries
        - Clavicle fracture
- What is the prognosis?
    - 90% resolve without intervention
    - Spontaneous recovery after 2 years
- ⚠️ What are good prognostic factors? Poor prognostic factors?
    - **Good:** Biceps and deltoids power 3/5 by **2 months**
    - **Poor:**
        - Lack of biceps function **6 months** after injury
        - **Preganglionic** = Horner’s present, poor rhomboid, avulsion types
- What are the long term sequelae of obstetric BPI?
    - **glenohumeral dysplasia** with 3 things:[](https://www.orthobullets.com/pediatrics/4117/obstetric-brachial-plexopathy-erbs-klumpkes-palsy#2252)
        - increased **glenoid retroversion,**
        - humeral **head flattening,**
        - posterior **humeral head subluxation**  [](https://www.orthobullets.com/evidence/22992884)
    - develops in 70% of infants with obstetric brachial plexopathy
    
    ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Injuries%20f5e12367f8b346c1a372bb35e9658569/Untitled%2012.png)
    
- Management?
    - Goal = maintain PROM, supple joints and muscle strength, stretching
    - Ortho = monitor for shoulder subluxation or dislocation
    - If need op, recommend within first 6 months of life.
    - Nerve graft ➔ Transfer ➔ tendon transfer
