Studies: Revised x 1
Topic: Physical Exam

- 5 Clinical aims of PE
    - 1. Determine the **level** of the lesion (Pre/ Post ganglionic) (supraclavicular infraclavicular).
    - 2. Determine the **extent and completeness** of the injury (sensory and motor deficit) with **segmental** injuries of the peripheral nerves - MUR
    - 3. Determine the presence of any **poor prognostic** signs (preganglionic injuries)
    - 4. Assess for **recovery** - Tinel's Test, Deep Muscle Squeeze Test
    - 5. Look for signs of previous treatment - **scars**
- Look and Inspect
    - At the limb first
        - Asymmetry of UL with considerable wasting from shoulders, arm, forearms and KIV hand
        - Attitude of the Upper limb - Erb
        - **Look at hands** immediately can tell partial vs complete because isolated Klumpke is very very rare

        - Clawing of hands - simmian hand
        - Scars including axilla, inner arm [Oberlin], wasting of muscles
            - Scar inside of arm - oberlin transfer

            - If any scars in inner arm, offer to look at thigh for Doi transfer scar
                
                ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%202.png)
                
    - Look from the **sides** - confirm wasting of muscles
    - Look from **back** -
        - Asymmetry and wasting of the periscapular muscles
        - Scar - Lat Dorsi Transfer
            
            ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%203.png)
            
    - Face - **Horner's Syndrome** - includes ptosis, meiosis (small pupil), anhydrosis and enophthalmos
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - **Neck - Cervical Scoliosis -** head tilts AWAY from injured side due to paralysis of para cervical muscles
- Feel and sensation
    - Feel over bony prominences for previous fractures, especially clavicle and scapular fractures
    - Feel for changes down the arm associated with sweating
    - Feel for radial artery as vascular structures may be compromised in severe injury
    - Lift for arms and Look for axilla
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - **Dermatomes** by ASIA Score
- Move - ASIA score
    - ASIA score myotomes first - confirm which roots involved [be careful of post tendon transfers]
    - "So far, i have found that the C5-C7 roots are involved, with/ without horner's syndrome. Go on to check for preganglionic involvement with muscles from the roots and drunks"
- Now, confirm pre ganglionic by Testing muscles from root and trunks (Pre-ganglionic)
    - 2 muscles from roots
        - Dorsal scapular nerve (C5) – rhomboids,
            
            ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%206.png)
            
            - Hands on hip - push elbows backwards and towards the midline against resistance and palpate the rhomboid
            - Medial border of scapula moves closer to midline - check for asymmetry
        - Long thoracic nerve (C5, 6, 7) – serratus anterior
            - MEDIAL Winging of scapula - Push against wall with outstretched arm with fingers and palm pointing downwards on wall
            
            ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%207.png)
            
    - 1 muscles from Trunk
        - Suprascapular nerve - supraspinatus and infraspinatus
- "I want to now Check nerves for Neurotization" (2)
    - Stick out tongue - hypoglossal nerve available
    - Spinal Accessory nerve - check trapezius
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - Ulnar nerve - for Oberlin transfer (cross fingers) or specifically FCU
    - Contralateral nerves - C7 - check other limb triceps
- “Check muscles for tendon transfers” (2)
    - Lat Dorsi test
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - Pec Major
        
        ![Untitled](Brachial%20Plexus%20Examination%209c8564f538e24148af2351c9c5f612ef/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - LL check for previous scar/ injuries for gracillis DOI transfer
- Check recovery
    - **Tinel's** (distal to proximal)
    - **Deep muscle Squeeze test** = if painful on squeeze muscle, nerve is growing into motor endplate!
- Complete my exam by
    - Assessing function of the UL - write, eat
    - Complete walking the brachial plexus from proximal to distal
    - Doing bedside tests to check autonomic function - histamine test, sweat test, wrinkle test
    - Ask for Chest XR, Cervical XR

---

- Ask patient history on 4 things
    - Ask about MOI - energy gives hint to severity and thus prognosis of recovery. E.g. expressway RTA (likely complete, root) vs Small road injury
    - Nature and Radiation of pain - Where the neurologic pain radiates to will suggest partial or complete (to upper arm deltoid vs to hand); severe pain = avulsion
    - Presence of reinnervation = progress since then
    - Patient's social circumstance = impact on job and function
- Complete "Walking the brachial plexus proximally to distally"
    - 1. Check Sensation of Dermatomes )[Partial vs complete]
    - 2. Check Phrenic nerve (percussion test) [Root vs Distal]
    - 3. Check Rhomboids (scapular retraction) [Root vs distal]
    - 4. Check Long Thoracic nerve (winging) [Root vs distal]
    - 5. Check Supraspinatus (ER and feel for SS bulk) [Plan for transfer SS nerve]
    - 6. Check Axillary nerve (deltoid) [Extent - posterior cord]
    - 7. Check lat Dorsi (thoracodorsal nerve) [extent - posterior cord]
    - 8. Check pectoralis muscles (clavicular head (MP) and sternal head (LP) [Extent medial or lateral cord]
    - 9. Check radial nerve - EPL, finger and wrist drop [Extent]
    - 10. Check Ulnar nerve - finger criss cross [Extent, plan for oberlin]
    - 11. Check Median nerve - AIN and thmb abduction
    - 12. Check musculocutaneous nerve - Biceps

- Possible things to demonstrate
    - Phrenic nerve - percussion test
    - How do you check muscles from nerves?
- Interesting case in Dave Lee Clinic

    - Clawed hand = total or lower BPI
    - Check sensation - C5 intact, C6,7,8 lost
    - Check power - Biceps ok (but has transfer done)
    - trapezius - intact
    - did not check pecs
