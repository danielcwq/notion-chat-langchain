### Spinal Cord Injuries

- What is neurogenic shock?
    - Neurogenic shock – Hypotension and relative bradycardia due to loss of sympathetic tone
- How do you resuscitate in neurogenic shock?
    - Will need vasopressors - Adrenaline or nor-adreanline
- What are the types of respiratory dysfunction for the C-spine?
    - Primarily affects inspiration
    - C3,4,5 - diaphragm
    - C2 - 7 - accessory muscles - SCM, scalene, upper trapezius

- What is spinal shock?
    - **Spinal Shock** – Temporary loss of spinal cord function = Flaccid. Also has hypotension and brady. Check Bulbocavernosus reflex **OR** anal reflex
    - Clinically, when spinal cord injury, there should be spastic paralysis, hyperreflexia below the lesion, sensory loss, along with neurogenic bowel and bladder and sexual dysfunction
    - but in spinal shock, there is **flaccid** paralysis and hyporeflexia
    - [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41394-019-0251-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41394-019-0251-3)
- What is **Bulbocavernosus reflex?**
    - required to **squeeze the glans penis** in men and most commonly touching the clitoris (or labium minus) in women to stimulate the reflex while checking for a reflex contraction of the external anal sphincter
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%201.png)
        
- What is **Anal reflex aka anal wink?**
    - For the anal reflex, the **testing of the S4-5 dermatome** by a safety pin is already performed as part of the ASIA score and as such, the examiner only needs to monitor for the visible contraction of the anal sphincter muscles during this test.
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%202.png)
        
- Do we have to wait for recovery from spinal shock before evaluation?
    - No need because spinal shock can last for days to weeks
- What is the ASIA scoring?
    - A - total loss of sensation and motor
    - B - sensation only, motor 0 (”anal sparing”
    - C - sensation + motor < 3/5
    - D - sensation + motor > 3/5
    - E - normal
    - Spinal level is defined as the most caudal (inferior) functioning root level with **intact sensation and Grade 3 or greater** motor function; however, the lowest normal sensory level may be substituted in regions without readily testable myotomes (such as in the thoracic spine).”
        
        [Classifications In Brief: American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5384910/)
        
- What is the definition of complete spinal cord injury?
    - No motor or sensory function preserved in sacral segments!

- What is your initial management for spinal cord injury?
    - **Aim** is to prevent secondary cord injury and to **maintain perfusion** to the spinal cord
    - **IV fluids** to maintain BP
    - Urinary **catheterization** to monitor output
- How do you evaluate fluid status in patient?
    - Clinical - BP, urine output, skin turgor
    - Bedside - US for IVC filling, kissing ventricles
    - Blood investigation - ABG, lactate
- Will you give **steroids** in acute spinal cord injury?
    - Based on UK NICE Guidelines, I will not give
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng41/chapter/Recommendations#emergency-department-assessment-and-management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng41/chapter/Recommendations#emergency-department-assessment-and-management)
    - Also 2016 Cochrane reviews that pooled evidence from 3 RCT did not demonstrate benefit for methylprednisolone
        - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4686530/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4686530/)
    - However, aware that this is controversial and is dependant on my specialist spine consultant and i will consult him
        - Aware that the AO spine 2017 CPG by Fehlings et al. recommend steroid if < 8 hour from injury; **to give 24 hours** of high does MPSS (30 mg/kg bolus followed by 5.4 mg/kg/h for 23 h)
        - Also Aware that **NASCIS 3 trial post-hoc analysis** shows that if methylpred given within 3-8 hours and continued for 48hr, more likely to improve one motor grade at 6 months
    - Singapore - most do not give Methylprednisolone. However, most give dexamethasone.

- What do you know about the NASCIS trials?
    - National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies by Bracken et al.
    - There were 3 RCTs in this trial series
        - 1984 trial - no difference BUT early case fatality and wound infection higher with steroids
        - 1990 trial - no difference.
        - 1998 trial - no difference
        - BUT in NASCIS 2 and 3, **post hoc subgroup analysis** showed that if given within 8 hours, more likely to improve **one motor grade** at **6** months

- Timing for intervention in cervical cord injury?
    - STASCIS trial - Surgical Timing in Acute SCI Study by Fehling et al. 2012
        - Decompression in < 24 hrs more likely for ASIA score to improve by **2 grades or more** at **6 months**
        - **20% vs 8.8%** chance. Odds 2.8x
        - Early intervention (24hours) should be considered.
        
        [STACIS.pdf](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/STACIS.pdf)
        
    - Recent Pooled analysis of 1500 patients in Lancet.
        - Surgical decompression within 24 h of acute SCI is associated with improved sensorimotor recovery. The first 24–36 h after injury appears to represent a crucial time window to achieve optimal neurological recovery with decompressive surgery following acute SCI.
        - [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30406-3/fulltext#:~:text=Surgical%20decompression%20within%2024%20h,decompressive%20surgery%20following%20acute%20SCI](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30406-3/fulltext#:~:text=Surgical%20decompression%20within%2024%20h,decompressive%20surgery%20following%20acute%20SCI).

- ⚠️ Patient with cervical cord injury suddenly develops hypertension crisis when there was urinary retention. Why?
    - **Autonomic dysreflexia** is a condition that emerges after a spinal cord injury, usually when the injury has occurred above the T6 level
    - Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system leads to an uncoordinated autonomic response that may result in a potentially life-threatening **hypertensive** episode when there is a **noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury**. In about 85% of cases, this stimulus is from a urological source such as a UTI, a distended bladder, or a clogged Foley catheter. There is a significantly increased risk of stroke by 300% to 400%
    - Patients usually develop autonomic dysreflexia one month to one year after their injury.
    - Objectively, an episode is defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure of 25 mm Hg.
- What are common stimuli of Autonomic Dysreflexia?
    - The most common stimuli are distention of a hollow viscus, such as the bladder or rectum. Pressure ulcers or other injuries such as fractures and urinary tract infections are also common causes.
- Immediate treatment for autonomic dysreflexia?
    - Monitoring of BP
    - Correct noxious stimuli
        - Bladder - check fo retention, foley blockage, kinking
        - Rectum - check for impaction (gentle)
    - Reduce BP
        - Sit patient upright
    - If BP still high ➔ pharmacologics = **nitrates** (either nitropaste or sublingual), nifedipine (oral or sublingual), sublingual **captopril**, intravenous hydralazine, intravenous **labetalol**

### CENTRAL CORD SYNDROME

- What is Central Cord Syndrome?
    - Answer by drawing the spinal cord anatomy (CTLS sequence)
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%206.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - Most common type of incomplete spinal cord injury
    - Acute on chronic condition where by there is baseline cervical central stenosis and after hyperextension injury, develops **central cord edema**, resulting in impairment of the region in the central cord
    - Blood supply is centripetal ➔ so there is also compromise of blood supply
    - Because of CTLS sequence, cervical nerves are affected preferentially; in the UL, distal weaker than proximal.
- What is the aetiology of central cord syndrome?
    - Traumatic vs Atraumatic causes
    - **Traumatic** - pre-existing cervical stenosis
    - **Atraumatic** - Syringomyelia, intramedullary cord tumors
- What is the prognosis of CCS?
    - Good prognosis, most are ambulatory at follow up
- What is the sequence of recovery?
    - LL ➔ then bowel bladder ➔ proximal UL ➔ hand function last
- What is the management?
    - Management is **controversial** and surgery can be considered if there is presence of mechanical instability or ongoing compression
    - Quote STACIS trial regards to timing
- What approach will you do?
    - Anterior or posterior approach depending on direction of compression
    - Usually, if the compression is restricted to one or two levels, the anterior approach is preferred; if more than two levels are involved, the posterior approach may be more advantageous.

### BROWN SEQUARD SYNDROME

- What is Brown Sequard Syndrome?
    - Hemisection of cord resulting in ipsilateral loss of motor and contralateral loss of sensation

### ANTERIOR CORD SYNDROME

- What is anterior cord syndrome?
    - Direct compression/ Anterior Spinal Artery injury (supplies 2/3 of spinal cord)
    - **LL > UL**
    - **Worst prognosis**
- ‼️ What is the blood supply of the spinal cord?
    - Supplied by the Anterior and Posterior Spinal arteries
        - **Anterior Spinal arteries** come from the **intercostal** arteries that then give rise to the artery of **Adamkiewicz** that runs on the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, supplying anterior 2/3 of the cord
        - **Posterior spinal arteries** comes from the **vertebral** artery to supply the posterior 1/3 of the cord

### Hangman Fracture

![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%209.png)

- What is it?
    - Traumatic spondylolisthesis of C2 on C3 due to fracture if bilateral pars interarticularis
- What is the mechanism of injury?
    - Hyperextension injury due to rapid deceleration
- ‼️ ⚠️ How do you classify hangman fractures? What is injured at each stage?
    - **Levine and Edwards**
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2010.png)
        
        - 1 = translation < 3mm [UNDISPLACED - C2/C3 disc, ALL, PLL all intact]
        - 2 = **> 3mm** / angulation **< 11°** [PLL torn]
        - **2a** = Severe angulation > 11° [ALL, PLL and Disc TORN]
        - **3** = + facet dislocation [Very unstable]
    - Typical vs Atypical
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2011.png)
        
        - Atypical - involve vertebral body with a coronally oriented fracture line
        - Typical = does not involve VB
- How does typical vs atypical fractures affect presentation?
    - John starr et al. 1993
    - Atypical fractures more frequently accompanied by paralysis and neurology as the anterior elements being still fixed with the posterior elements translate backwards
    
    [starr1993.pdf](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/starr1993.pdf)
    
- What other injuries concerned? What further imaging?
    - Vertebral artery injury ➔ CT angiogram
- What are the usual presentation of the patient?
    - usually Neurologically intact due to capacious spinal canal
    - Also, separation of fragments decompresses the canal.

- Why do injuries at C1 and C2 not frequently present with neurology?
    - Steel's rule of thirds states that **the area inside the atlas is equally occupied in thirds by the dens, spinal cord, and space**.
    - The space is primarily occupied by cerebrospinal fluid.
    - This accounts for the low incidence of spinal cord injuries associated with C1 and C2 fractures.
    
    ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2012.png)
    
- Management of TYPE 1/ 2, Low grade HANGMAN? [Majority]
    - Non operative with HARD COLLAR because ligaments still intact especially ALL
- Role of Halo vest in Type 1/2?
    - Previously advocated
    - But recently found no difference in union rates and lower complication rates with hard collar
    
    [Typical vs Atypical.pdf](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Typical_vs_Atypical.pdf)
    
- Management of Type 2a/3 unstable Hangman
    - Posterior C1-3 fusion (oldest method) = sacrifices 50% Rotation ROM
    - **Posterior** C2-3 Fusion
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2013.png)
        
    - **Anterior** C2-3 interbody fusion [kiv mandible osteotomy]
    

### Dens Fracture

- What are the key ligaments of the C0/C1/C2 joint?
    - 4 key ligaments
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2014.png)
        
    - Transverse Ligament - C1 to C2
    - Apical ligament - C2 tip to Occpiput
    - Alar ligaments - C2 to base of occiput
    - Tectorial membrane (that continues as the PLL)
- Is this a common fracture?
    - Fracture of the odontoid process is the most common fracture of the upper cervical spine, accounting for 10% to 16% of all fractures of the cervical spine.
- What is the blood supply of Dens? Why risk of non union?
    - Combination of watershed blood supply and ligaments attaching to odontoid tip creating a distracting force
    - Apex perfused by Internal carotid artery
    - Base by vertebral artery
- Classification of Dens Fracture?
    - AndersOn and D'AlOnzO - OOO
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2015.png)
        
    - Grauer classifx
        - Type 2 is anterosuperior to posterior inferior ➔ amenable to AP screw
        - Type 3 is opposite ➔ need posterior fusion
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- What pre op investigation?
    - CT angio needed to assess for vertebral artery abberency
    - Normal Vertebral artery anatomy - goes thru transverse foramen of C1 and C6 (but not C7)
- How will you manage a Dens Type 1?
    - Non op, treated symptomatically, no need surgery

### TYPE 2

- What are the risks of nonunion in non operative management?
    - **3 risk factors identified by Koivikko JBJS 2004.**
        - Fracture gap >1 mm),
        - Posterior displacement (> 5 mm) on admission
        - Delayed start of treatment (> 4 days)
        - 
        
        [koivikko2004.pdf](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/koivikko2004.pdf)
        
    - Others - # comminution, patient factors - DM, smoker, osteoporosis
- How will you manage a DISPLACED Dens # Type 2 IN **ELDERLY** PATIENT?
    - This is highly controversial
    - Im aware that there are higher risks of nonunion if treated non operatively in this age group due to osteoporosis. (Also risk of catastraopic neurological injury with subsequently falls or late onset of progressive myelopathy.)
        - Risk of need for delayed surgical treatment
    - However, surgery though better union rates, also comes with its own risks and may not alter functional outcomes.
    - I will discuss with the patient and family the risks and benefits to agree on the treatment plan.
    - If decided for non operative, there are the options of Halo vs Hard collar. - Harrop et al. systematic review in Spine reccomends use of hard collar immobilization
        - Halo has high complication and mortality rates but better union rates. (high risk of aspiration, pneumonia and death)
        - Collar has higher risk of nonuion, fibrous non union, however not necessary for outcome satisfaction
        - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20881465/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20881465/) (harrop et al.)
- How will you manage a DISPLACED Dens # Type 2 IN **YOUNG** PATIENT?
    - Identify the risk factors of non union
    - High risk non union in younger patient ➔ I am inclined for surgical management
    - Decision based on orientation of fracture line as per Gauer classification
        - Type 2 = anterior screw
        - Type 3 = posterior C1-2 fusion. Options of fusion
            - Trans-articular magerl screws
            - Lateral mass screws
            - pedicle screws
- Difference between AP screw vs Posterior fusion?
    - Preservation of ROM! - AA Joint provides 50% of rotation in the neck!
- How about salvage for severely posteriorly displaced dens?
    - Transoral Odontoidectomy
    - Usually combined with posterior stabilization procedure

### TYPE 3

- Dens # Type 3 management??
    - High rates of union
    - Immobilization can be either by halo or hard collar

### Facet Dislocation

- What are the classic presentation for uni vs bilateral facet dislocation?
    - Unilateral ➔ **radiculopathy** (but harder to reduce)
    - Bilateral ➔ Spinal cord injury in **80%**!(disc herniation more likely)
- What are the XR findings? What percentage subluxation?
    - Unilateral (25%) vs
    - Bilateral (>25%) subluxation
    - "Bow-tie" sign and “Laminar space” sign - due to rotational malalignment - these are seen in unilateral. Bilateral no rotational malalignment
    
    ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2017.png)
    
- CT scan sign?
    - Reverse Hamburger Sign
- What other investigations?
    - MRI - evaluate disc involvement, extent of posterior ligamentous injury, spinal cord compression, epidural hematoma
    - CT angiogram - to evaluate vertebral artery
- Do you need MRI before reduction?
    - Consensus is for MRI prior to reduction if it does not delay reduction in the setting of neurology.
    - I am aware that some institutions attempt closed reduction without MRI for alert patients
    - But in my instutition, I am able to get MRI without delay.
- What is your management plan?
    - After my MRI,
    - if the MRI shows no disc retropulsion ➔ trial of closed reduction
    - If MRI shows big disc retropulsion ➔ will consider decompression, reduction and fusion as it may be safer. Will discuss with senior spine surgeon
        - Reduction in big disc rupture may lead to spinal cord compression when reducing
- How do you apply Gardner well tongs?
    
    ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2018.png)
    
    - 1cm above pinna (entire outer ear), 1cm posterior to Extra-auditory meatus; below equator to prevent slippage; starting with 10lb
    - Tighten until Spring loaded indicator protrude 1mm = about **30lbs**
        - Temporal bone failure is 216 llbs
        - Mayfield pins 60lbs
    - Some flexion moment
- How do you do a closed reduction?
    - **Supine position, II and neuromonitoring**
    - Apply traction - 10lbs for the head, 5lbs for each cervical level at 10minutes interval.
    - Place towels under head to create **flexion** posture
    - Reduction technique of unilateral facet dislocation
        - Reduction maneuver after facet distracted to a perched position
        - Maintain axial load and rotate 30-40˚ past midline in direction of dislocation
        - Stop once reduction is felt, confirm with xrays
    - Reduction technique of bilateral dislocation
        - Reduction maneuver after facet distracted to a perched position
        - Palpate stepoff in spinal process posteriorly and apply an anterior directed force caudal to level of dislocation
        - Rotate head 40˚ beyond midline in one direction, and then rotate 40˚ in the other direction while axial traction maintained
        - Once facet unlocked, removed towels to extend head
    - Throughout, monitor neurology, and also check reduction on II
    
    ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2019.png)
    
    - **3 possible outcomes**
        - 1. New neurological deficit during reduction ➔ stop and proceed for Open
        - 2. Maximum traction weight reached but not reduced ➔ stop and proceed for open
        - 3. Successful reduction ➔ maintain traction with weights ➔ plan for surgical fixation
- Role for non operative management in **unilateral** facet dislocation?
    - Non op fallen out of favour due to high rates of instability and treatment failure with non operative management.
    - If non op - can consider Halo vest but rarely done today.

- How do you do anterior open reduction?
    - [Spine Approaches/ Fusion Approaches](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26.md)
    - Reduce with Caspar pins
    - If unable to reduce, may need combined posterior approach
- How will you fix this?
    - 360 fusion for bilateral
    - Can consider anterior only or posterior only for unilateral
- What if it is C2/3 dislocation? **How to access?**
    - Can do mandible osteotomy

### Halo Vest

- Indications for HALO vest?
    - Supra-axial spine to limit rotation and dlexion
    - C1/2 - 50% of head rotationn
    - C0/C1 = 50 % of head flexion
- ‼️ How do you apply Halo vest?
    - Require **3** assistants – 1 to hold, 2 to apply
    - Choose equipment
        - Choose appropriate halo ring size by measuring skull circumference - should provide 1-2cm clearance around head.
        - Choose appropriate vest size - measure at level of xiphoid process
    - Prepare Pin position
        - 2 anterior pins – 1cm above orbital ridge, just beneath equator of skull at medial 2/3 and lateral 1/3 junction of orbit
            - Protect supraorbital nerve
        - 2 posterior pins – opposite anterior pins at **4 and 8 oclock**

    - Pin insertion technique
        - Under LA with **eyes tightly closed** to prevent trapping of the frontalis muscle
        - Insert pins **perpendicular** to the skull bone, Tighten 2 **diagonally** opposed pins **simultaneously** with torque screw driver
        - Tighten to **8 inch-pound** torque (adults)
    - Torque
        - Adults – **4** pins at in-8lbs
        - Children – more pins with less tourque (**8-10** pins; 2 in-lbs)

    - Connect vest to ring with 4 rods at the pins
        - Secure pin to vest with nuts and screws
    - Check XR after placement of vest
    - Follow up
        - Pins should be tightened carefully **once a day for 3 days**, then check tightness every 3 days
        - Pins should not be tightened more than a full turn at any visit
- Complications of Halo Vest?
    - Can be divided in the various structures involved
        - Skin - infection, pressure, abrasions in vest
        - nerve - abducens nerve (LR6), supraorbital nerve
        - Muscle - frontalis trapped - unable to open eyes
        - Artery - temporal artery
        - Bone - through the skull
        - Brain - injury to brain
        - Failure
    - Most commonly injured nerve – **abducens** nerve **CN 6**
    - Others – **supraorbital** nerve
    - Pin site infection, Dural puncture
- Why is abducens nerve injured most common?
    - Longest intra-cranial pathway
- What can this halo also be used for?
    - Traction for scoliosis

### Atlas C1 Fracture

- How can you classify C1 fractures?
    - Levine and Edwards (same name as Hangman)
    
    ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2023.png)
    
    - A = posterior arch only
    - B = unilateral lateral mass
    - C = Jefferson burst = fracture of both anterior and posterior arch
    - D = isolated anterior arch
- ⚠️ How does one determine stability of a C1 fracture?
    - **3 things** = ADI, PADI, Rule of Spence
        - Sum of lateral mass displacement on open mouth view
            - **> 8.1** = unstable = **TAL ruptured [aka Rule of Spence] [6.9 without magnification]**
        - ADI > **5mm**
        - PADI < **14mm**
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2024.png)
        
- What determines the need for surgical fixation in a C1 fracture?
    - Stability of C1/C2 junction as determines by the integrity of the Transverse Ligament
- How do you treat a stable C1 #?
    - Hard collar
- How do you treat unstable C1 #?
    - Posterior C1/2 fusion
    - Halo vest

### Subaxial Vertebral Fractures

- ‼️ ⚠️ Do you always need XR for C-spine clearance?
    - No. I will decide based on the NEXUS criteria - NSAID. If any present, I will do.
    - N - Neurodeficit
    - S - spinal tenderness
    - A - AMS
    - I - Intoxication
    - D - presence of Distracting injuries
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2025.png)
        
- What are you looking for on the XR?
    - Comment on adequacy - it should show till T1, ask for open mouth for C2 peg and AP view looking for symmetry
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2026.png)
        
    - **4 lines** - Anterior vertebral line, Posterior vertebral line, spinolaminar line, Posterior spinous line
    - Look for subluxation < 25 or > 25 % for dislocation
    - Lateral view
        - [Atlantoaxial dissociation] If ADI > 5mm = disruption of TAL
        - If PADI < 14mm = disruption of TAL
        - [Occipitocervical Dissociation] **Harris rule of 12**
            - Basion-dens interval (tip of basion to tip of dens)
            - Basion-Axial interval (perpendicular distance from basion to vertical line along the posterior dens)
            - Both less than 12 (better and easier to use than Power's ratio)
            
            ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2027.png)

    - **Compression** (AO Type A)
        - No involvement of posterior body cortex
    - **Flexion Tear drop** (AO Type B) ➔ **Most severe** (almost like a Chance 3 column Fracture)
        - High energy with fracture of anterior inferior portion of vertebra
        - Often a/w PLC injury, SCI, extremely unstable (Chance –type fracture ➔ bony or ligamentous
    - **Extension tear drop** (AO Type B)
        - Small fleck of bone avulsed from anterior end plate
    - **Burst** (AO Type A)
        - Posterior body cortex fractured with retropulsion
    - AO Type C -Translation injury
    - Type F - facet joint injuries
    - **Clay Shoveler’s**
        - Avulsion # of spinous process C6/C7/ T1 --> stable injury
- Flexion tear drop vs extension tear drop?

- Management of flexion tear drop fracture?
    - Behaves like a Chance injury in the C-spine
    - High energy flexion, compression injury of anterior
- ‼️ How do you classify severity and management in subaxial C-spine fractures?
    - **S**ubaxia**L** **I**njury **C**lassification by the Spinal Study Group Vaccaro et al. 2007 (SLIC)

    - vs TLICS. Distraction lower than translation;
    - **3 components**
        - Morphology
        - Integrity of disco ligamentous complex (not PLC!)
        - Neurological status
    - Scoring/
        - < 4 = Non Op
        - 4 = surgeon decide
        - > 4 (5 or more) = consider op
- Surgical principles?
    - Principles = Decompress, Reduce, Stabilize
    - Approach – anterior vs posterior
    - Fusion
        - Anterior – ACDF/ ACCF
        - Posterior – Fusion with lateral mass screws
        - KIV anterior + posterior

### Paeds - Pseudosubluxation

![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2033.png)

- What is psuedosubluxation?
    - Subluxation in children up to 8 yo
    - C2/C3 subluxation in 40% of children
    - C3/C4 subluxation in 14%
- What is the etiology?
    - Etiology: horizontal Facet joints
- ‼️ How to differentiate true or pseudosubluxation?
    
    ![Untitled](Cervical%20Spine%20Trauma%20a6fb4c29646149a0a495944a91bdac33/Untitled%2034.png)
    
    - Draw posterior spinolaminar line along C1 and C3 aka Swischuk Line
    - If C2 is deviated < 2mm = pseudosubluxation
    - If C2 is deviated > 2mm = true subluxation
    - Other factors that support it is pseudo:
        - Reduction of subluxation with neck extension - retake XR with neck in extension
        - No trauma
