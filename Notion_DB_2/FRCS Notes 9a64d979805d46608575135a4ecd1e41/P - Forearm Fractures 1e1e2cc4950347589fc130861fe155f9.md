## P Nursemaid Elbow/ Pulled Ebow (#‚ùå)

- What is pulled elbow? MOI?
    - Annular ligament becomes interposed between radial head and capitellum
    - MOI: Longitudinal traction injury
- How to reduce?
    - **Supination technique** = **supinate**, **hyperflex** with thumb pressing head

    ## P - Radial neck Fractures
    
    - Classification?
        - Judet
        - Type 1 = undisplayed
        - 2 = < 30¬∞
        - 3 = 30 - 60¬∞
        - 4 = > 60¬∞
        - 
    - Management?
        - Types 1, 2 (<30¬∞) = Non Op
        - Types 3, 4 (>30¬∞) = Op
        - Closed KIV Open reduction
        - Techniques:
            - **Mentaizeau** retrograde technique with flexible nail

## P - Radial Neck Fracture

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Classification of radial neck fracture?
    - **Judet**
        - Type 1 = undisplayed
        - 2 = < 30¬∞
        - 3 = 30 - 60¬∞
        - 4 = > 60¬∞

## P- Forearm Fractures

<aside>
üí° **Mx Goals** = Achieve union, painfree, functional forearm
**Principles** = Physis open, Flexible nails with second stage removal upon union at 6 months

</aside>

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What is the most important predictor of poor malunion and function (and thus relative indication for op)?
    - Based on Robert et al. 1986 study, **radial deviation** is the most important factor in both mid shaft and distal radius fractures
    - Midshaft radius # - radial deviation > 15 ¬∞ led to loss of rotation, but not < 15
    - Ulnar deviation and dorsal angulation had no impact on rotation
    - **Age - >10** led to higher incidence of rotational deformity
- What is the management?
    - Flexible nails x 2

## P - Distal Radius Fracture

- What Salter Harris is it most commonly?
    - SH2 = with metaphyseal fragment
- What is the cast index?
    - **Cast index** = Ratio of inner diameter of cast in sagittal divided by AP
        - Purpose is you want the cast to sandwich the fracture to prevent dorsal and palmar angulation

    - Traditionally **0.7** and below is the target
    - This study say 0.81
        - [https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/abs/10.1302/0301-620X.92BSUPP_IV.0920598a](https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/abs/10.1302/0301-620X.92BSUPP_IV.0920598a)
- Indications for surgery?
    - Indications: > 30 ¬∞ in sagital, > 10 ¬∞ in coronal
- What is the surgical management? Any special technique?
    - CRPP
    - **Intrafocal Kapandji Reduction Technique**

    - Pins placed into fracture site and used to buttress distal fragment into position
    - Held in place with 2 oblique K-wires from **radial styloid**
