- What is the deformity in SCFE?
    - Epiphysis remains in place
    - Metaphysis moves **Anteriosuperiorly**
- What layer of Physis does this occur?
    - Slip is through the **zone of provisional calcification** in zone of Hypertrophy
    - [renal cause] = in secondary spongiosum
- Risk Factors for SCFE?
    - 60% with **endocrinopathy** has bilateral slips (Renal dystrophy, hypothyroid, Growth hormone)
        - Renal failure osteodystrophy, Hypothyroidism, GH deficiency,
    - **Anatomical** - increased femoral retroversion, acetabular retroversion
        - Vertical physis in this age group (goes from 160 ¬∞ at birth to 125 ¬∞ at skeletal maturity ‚ûî increased shearing forces
- Classic patient?
    - Male, Obese, Adolescent 12 years old
- How will you assess clinically?
    - **Hx** = Duration (acute on chronic), PMHx, function, hip or knee pain, age 12-13 yo
    - 50% have hip pain, 25-50% have referred pain in knee (medial obturator nerve)
    - BMI, weight
    - **Drehmann sign** ‚Äì obligatory External rotation of limb when flexing hip
    - Ability to weight bear (stability)
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è How do you classify SCFE?
    - By Stability = **Loder** (Loder et al. of 55 patients. **47% AVN in unstable, 0% in stable**)
        - Stable ‚Äì able to WB with or without **crutches**
        - Unstable ‚Äì cannot WB even with crutches
    - By chronicity
        - Acute = **< 3** week
        - Chronic **> 3** week (most common ‚Äì 85%!)
    - By severity = **Southwick** angle [can be AP]
        - Mild < 30, mod 30-50, Severe > 30

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What investigations and what signs on XR?
    - **XR - AP**
    - **Trethowan‚Äôs** sign = **Klein‚Äôs** line passes above epiphysis.

    - Metaphyseal blanch sign of **steel** = crescent shape dense area (due to overlap of epiphysis and metaphysis)
        
        ![Untitled](SCFE%20572100a299494089a539159e6a052866/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - Features of **Chronicity** ‚Äì Callus formation over infero-posterior neck
    - **XR ‚Äì Frog leg lateral. -AVOID but do the cross table lateral.**
    - **Southwick** angle = perpendicular line from line from anterior and posterior tip of epiphysis \/ anatomical axis of **diaphysis**
        - < 30 = mild
        - 30-60 = moderate
        - > 60 = severe

- What kind of lateral XR to do?
    - Cross table lateral instead of frog leg lateral
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è How will you **manage SCFE**?
    - Aim is to **prevent progression and fusion of the physis.**
    - My management of choice is ‚Äúinsitu single screw fixation using the ‚Äúapproach-withdrawal‚Äù technique
    - This is done on a traction table, with no attempt at reduction or traction but achieving serendipitous reduction when patient is under GA and muscle relaxation
    - Using II to plan the entry point:
        - Guidepin placed perpendicular to the physis on AP image ‚ûî draw line
        - Same done for lateral image
        - Incision made at intersection of lines; the more the slip, the more anterior the entry point
        - Guidepin advanced to anterolateral cortex, into center of epiphysis perpendicular to physis.
    - Aim for **6.5mm** or 7.3mm cannulated, fully threaded screw with 5 threads across and 5mm away from joint line (to prevent chondrolysis)
    - I will rotate hip or C-arm during live fluoroscopy to obtain images that show the screw tip approach the subchondral bone and then subsequently withdraw from the bone. [sunrise sunset views]
    - Postoperatively
        - Stable ‚Äì WBAT
        - Unstable ‚Äì **NWB x 6/52, PWB x 6/52**
    - Follow up
        - Till closure of contralateral physis
- How do you ensure screw is not in joint?
    - Sunrise Sunset views
    - Fluoroscopy
    - **Inject dye through the cannulation** of screw to see if go into joint.
- When do you consider contralateral pinning?
    - **Atypical slips** - Female, < 10 yo, medical conditions (endocrinopathy)
    - unreliable follow up.
- What are the complications of SCFE?
    - **AVN** ‚Äì 47% in unstable slips
    - **Chondrolysis**
        - Decrease in apparent joint space of > 2mm compared w contralateral hip.
    - Radiographic OA - 27%
    - **FAI**
        - Due to Proximal femoral deformity Resulting from the external rotation deformity
        - Mx = Proximal femoral intertrochanteric osteotomy to correct deformity (flex, valgus and internal rotate)
- How do you know there is chondrolysis?
    - Decrease in apparent joint space of **> 2mm** compared w contralateral hip.

- Limited ROM due to FAI as late sequelae. How do you manage?
    - Cam type impingement in the anterolateral femoral metaphysis due to slip being pinned insitu
        
        ![Untitled](SCFE%20572100a299494089a539159e6a052866/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - **Mx options:**
        - Arthroscopic bumpectomy
        - Open bumpectomy with smith petersen approach
        - Osteotomy - intertrochanteric e.g. Imhauser vs Subtrochanteric e.g. Southwick

- How does SCFE lead to hip dysplasia?
    - Journal of Children‚Äôs orthopaedics Maranho et al. 2018
    - Found that acetabular dysplasia observed in 25% of patients with SCFE
    - Risk factors - age at slip, SCFE severity and femoral head overgrowth

## CONTROVERSIES IN SCFE

- Timing?
    - Controversial
    - **Lowndes et al. 2009 Meta-analaysis** ‚Äì for unstable SCFE, Fixation < 24 hour lower risk of AVN
    - Philips JBJS 2001 follow up of 100 cases of SCFE over 26 years, 14 were unstable, fix < 24 hours, no risk of AVN
    - In patient with unstable hips, I will therefore try to fix within 24 hours
- Number of screws?
    - Even though 2 screws show better biomechanical stability but one pin has lower risk of chondrolysis.

- SCFE - Number of threads for screw across physis?
    - **5 threads**. **Carney et al.** JPO 2003 - 37 children with 46 stable slips
        - 20% of stable slips progressed and all had < 5 threads.
        - None with > 5 threads progressed.
- Type of screw?
    - I will use a **‚Äúreverse cutting, fully threaded screws‚Äù** to facilitate future removal if required.
    - Fully threaded vs partially threaded
    - Mazzini et al. JPO 2012 ‚Äì found that fully threaded screws had lower screw removal complication rates.
- Role of capsulotomy?
    - Consider in unstable to decompress
- Role of reduction?
    - Possible role in unstable SCFE but no consensus
        
        ![Untitled](SCFE%20572100a299494089a539159e6a052866/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - **Some authors suggest open reduction in acute slips. Techniques include**
    - **Parsch** technique ‚Äì using fingers through the **Watson- jones** approach (TFL // Glute med) ‚Äì to feel the slip and reduce under tactile guidance before driving pin across physis.

    - **Dunn** technique ‚Äì Lateral position, **Ganz trochanteric flip osteotomy**, creation of retinacular flap and then anterior dislocation of hip [[Hip + Pelvis Approaches](Hip%20+%20Pelvis%20Approaches%207fa0baff5c5e4ef88e58e0f9ff20553f.md)]
- Screw removal?
    - Routine removal is controversial
    - Some advocate due to risk of trochanteric bursitis, future stress riser or difficulty for future arthroplasty
    - Risk of breakage of implant when removing
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è Any evidence for insitu pinning vs open reduction?
    - **JPO 2014 - Christopher et al. 88 hips**. Insitu fixation for 71, Dunn procedure for 17 hips.
        - STABLE - 2 out of 10 stable hips with Dunn procedure developed AVN (20%)
        - UNSTABLE - 2 of 7 unstable hips with Dunn procedure developed AVN (29%)
    - Stable hips - Open reduction lead to AVN 20% (compared to 0% in Loder study) ‚ûî Should be done with caution
    - Unstable - both problematic with high AVN rates
