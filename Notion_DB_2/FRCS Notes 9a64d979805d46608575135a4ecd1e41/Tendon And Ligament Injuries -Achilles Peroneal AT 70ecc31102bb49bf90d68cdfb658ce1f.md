### Achilles Tendon Rupture

<aside>
💡 ** History - ask DURATION of injury. Acute/ Chronic will change your discussion!

</aside>

- What are the risk factors for achilles tendon rupture?
    - Intrinsic – steroids, Fluoroquinolones, renal insufficiency, gout, previous steroid injection
    - Extrinsic – weekend warriors
- Why does it rupture?
    - Watershed area 2-6cm from attachment

- How will you assess this patient (Hx an PE)?
    - Hx
        - MOI - Duration (chronicity),
        - Risk factors - steroids, Fluoroquinolones, renal insufficiency, gout, previous steroid injection
    - PE
        - Thompson’s aka Simmonds Test – patient prone, squeeze calves
        - Palpable gap
        - Weakness in plantar flexion
- How will you investigate? What sign on XR?
    - XR – Obliteration of Kager’s triangle in presence of rupture
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20And%20Ligament%20Injuries%20-Achilles%20Peroneal%20AT%2070ecc31102bb49bf90d68cdfb658ce1f/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - US/ MRI
- What are you looking for in advanced imaging?
    - Confirm the injury and to evaluate extent of retraction
    - No consensus on looking at extent of retraction but literature has described the use of US to evaluate suitability of non-operative treatment. Several surgical units use the cut off of 5mm to determine non apposition of the tendons.
    - Kotnis et al. AJSM 2006 - dynamic US with foot in equinus. Patients with gap of > 5mm ➔ surgery; gap < 5mm ➔ no surgery
    
    [dynamic US for AT rupture.pdf](Tendon%20And%20Ligament%20Injuries%20-Achilles%20Peroneal%20AT%2070ecc31102bb49bf90d68cdfb658ce1f/dynamic_US_for_AT_rupture.pdf)
    
- How will you manage acutely?
    - Acute Mx = Front slab, keep in equinus

- How do you definitively manage ACUTE achilles rupture?
    - “**No Consensus on optimal treatment** – Non op with early functional rehab, Open repair, MIS repair. I will decide based on **patient and injury factors**
        - Patient = activity, sports, function
        - Injury = complete/ incomplete/ chronicity
    - Complication rates in **Cochrane review 2012:**
        - **Rerupture Lower in Op 4% vs 10%**
        - **Complications** other than re-rupture higher in Op vs Non op
        - **MIS vs Open** – higher risk of **Sural** nerve injury; lower risk of infection

    - **Willitz JBJS 2010 RCT** – 144 patients; open vs non op; f/u 2 years; no difference in strength, ROM, calf circumference at 3/6/12/24 mth
        
        [Willitz.pdf](Achilles%20Tendon%20Rupture%20b3e0231b93f1471d9f58e92c5f8c77ce/Willitz.pdf)
        
    - **Keating JBS 2011 RCT** – 80 patients; non op vs open – no difference in function at 1 year
    - Ideally placed in equinus in 48 hours. If > 48 hours, conservative mx may not have good outcomes (all the papers w good outcomes < 48 hours)
- What Conservative Protocol? (“accelerated functional rehab protocol”)
    - 0-2 wk front slab, NWB
    - 2-4 wk – air cast with 2cm heel lift, PWB
    - 4-6 air cast , 2cm, FWBAT
    - 6-8 wk.- remove heel lift
- Open techniques?
    - End to end Modified Kessler technique
- How do you definitively manage CHRONIC rupture?
    - **2-5cm** = VY lengthening
    - **> 5cm** – tendon transfer – **FHL** OR **ALLOGRAFT**
- Why FHL? How do you harvest the FHL?
    - 2nd strongest plantar flexor, in phase with gastroc complex, expendable tendon, similar axis of pull
    - **Knot of Henry** – where FHL crosses FDL, FHL is deep to FDL

### Achilles Tendinopathy

- What is the histology?
    - angiofibroblastic hyperplasia with mucoid degeneration
- What is the management of chronic achilles tendinopathy?
    - Non Op
        - PT - **Stanish et al. 1986** - paper on the Eccentric exercises for the achilles tendinopathy
            
            [stanish1986.pdf](Tendon%20And%20Ligament%20Injuries%20-Achilles%20Peroneal%20AT%2070ecc31102bb49bf90d68cdfb658ce1f/stanish1986.pdf)
            
        - Night splints
        - Shockwave therapy
    - Op - rarely done
        - **Radiofrequency** micro-debridement treatment (Topaz)
        - **Tendinoscopy**; takes anterior Paratenon off together with the new nerves. with proximal gastroc medial resection
- How does shock wave work?
    1. **“reinjuring”** the tissue to restart the healing response
    2. also helps with **pain modulation**
- Effectiveness of eccentric training?
    - Success rates of 60-90%
- How does tendinoscopy work?
    - Aims to denervate the painful area by releasing the paratenon from the achilles tendon, especially the anterior aspect of the tendon
    - Plantaris tendon is also released from the achilles.
    - "Postulated that plantaris insertion or its association with the TA may play a role in the symptomatology of non-insertional achilles tendinopathy

### Peroneal Tendon Subluxation

- What is the relationship of the peroneal tendons?
    
    ![Untitled](Tendon%20And%20Ligament%20Injuries%20-Achilles%20Peroneal%20AT%2070ecc31102bb49bf90d68cdfb658ce1f/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - PB is anterior to PL at level of lateral malleolus
    - PL is more superficial
    - Things that cross further are more superficial
        - cf. Henry’s Knot - FDL is more superficial
- What is the injury?
    - Injury to the **SUPERIOR** peroneal Retinaculum (SPR) that is attached from the fibula to the calcaneum
- What is the classification?
    - **Ogden** classification - depending on where the SPR is avulsed from - either from fibula or calcaneal end and whether there is cortical or cartilage ridge involvement
    - Grade 1 = elevation off fibula with **cartilage ridge**
    - G2 = elevation off cartilage ridge (ridge in place)
    - G3 = cortical avulsion [bony]
    - G4 = SPR torn off calcaneum
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20And%20Ligament%20Injuries%20-Achilles%20Peroneal%20AT%2070ecc31102bb49bf90d68cdfb658ce1f/Untitled%203.png)
        
- Management of Subluxating Peroneal tendons?
    - Non Op = Cast if tendon reduced
    - Op = Singapore operation first described in 1985
    - Consists of SPR repair +/- groove deepening
        - (James Hui et al. JBJS 1997)

### Ankle Sprain

- Do you always need to do XR?
    - No, can triage based on **Ottawa Ankle Rules.**
    - Suitable if > 18 years old, and should not be intoxicated/ no distracting injuries/ no neuropathy/ no gross swelling that prevents palpation of prominences
    - 4 areas to palpate:
        - 6cm distal aspect of fibula and tibia
        - Based of 5th MT
        - Navicular
    - Inability to bear weight both immediately and in emergency department
    - ➔ XR
- What is the non operative management for Ankle sprain?
    - PT and proprioception (wobble board) training
- What percentage of patients recover?
    - Around 20% of patient develop symptoms of chronic ankle instability
- Differential diagnosis for ankle sprain that does not recover?
    - Osteochondral defect, loose bodies
    - Peroneal tendon pathology e.g. Peroneal tendon tears
- What is the surgical management for ATFL injuries?
    - 3 general options
        - **Anatomical** **Repair** = Bostrom Gould repair
            - **Bostrum** = direct ligament repair
            - **Gould** = Augmentaion of **inferior** extensor retinaculum
            
            ![Untitled](Tendon%20And%20Ligament%20Injuries%20-Achilles%20Peroneal%20AT%2070ecc31102bb49bf90d68cdfb658ce1f/Untitled%205.png)
            
        - **Anatomical Reconstruction** = Use of auto/allografts to reconstruct anantomical ATFL and CFL
        - **Non- anatomical Reconstruction** = various described methods using **peroneus brevis** to augment the damanged ATFL. Incise proximal end of PB and:
            - **Evans** – PB to fibula
            - Watsons Jones – PB to fibula to talus
            - Chrisman Snook - PB to fibula to Calcaneus
