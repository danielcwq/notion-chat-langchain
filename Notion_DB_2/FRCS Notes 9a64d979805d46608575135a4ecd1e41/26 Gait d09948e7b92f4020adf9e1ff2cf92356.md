- Tell me about the gait cycle?
    - There are 2 main phases - Stance (60%) and Swing (40%) phases
    - Of which, each can be diveded into 4 phases each - HLMT, TIMT

    - **H**eel Strike - self explanatory
    - **L**oading Response - transition from heel strike to mid stance
    - **M**id Stance - defined as both ANKLES aligned in coronal plane
    - **T**erminal Stance - from midstance to toe off
    - **T**oe off - toe off (aka pre swing)
    - **I**nitial Swing - Maximum **knee** flexion
    - **M**id Swing - Defined as tibia vertical to the ground
    - **T**erminal Swing - Deceleration begins
- What is one step vs one stride?
    - Gait cycle is initial contact to initial contact of **same foot**
    - Step is initial contact to initial contact of **other foot**
    - Stride is initial contact to initial contact of **same foot = 1 gait cycle**

- How else can the stance phase be divided?
    - Stance phases can be divided into 3 rockers, each rocker has a distinct change in muscle action and **Ground Reaction Force** with relation to the knee.

    - **Heel rocker** (H+L) - GRF **posterior** to knee, Eccentric lengthening of Tibialis Anterior
    - **Ankle Rocker** (L+M+T) - GFR **anterior** (or in line with the knee) at knee, Eccentric contraction of calf muscles.
        - Quads contract to prevent buckling of the knee, maintaining the GRF to be anterior
    - **Forefoot Rocker** (Toe off) - GRF back to **posterior** to knee, Concentric contraction of calf

- Pre-requisites of normal gait?
    - **Perry** 1985 - these need to be present to allow normal walking
    - 2 in stance phase
        - 1. At Heel strike - Appropriate **pre-positioning** of foot
        - 2. Stance phase - **Stability** in Stance – stable foot position
    - 3 in swing phase
        - 3. Swing - Adequate foot **clearance** in swing – adequate flexion at hip
        - 4. Swing - Adequate **step length**
        - 5. Swing - **Energy** conservation – minimize vertical excursion
- ‼️ What are the determinants of gait?
    - These are factors that minimise displacement the body's center of gravity
    - Pelvic determinants (3) - rotation, tilt, lateral displacement

    - Knee determinants (2) motion and flexion

    - Foot and ankle motion

- Components of Gait Analysis?
    - Linear analysis – step length, stride length (same foot)
    - Kinematics – measurement of **movement** with markers
    - Kinetics – measure of **forces**, energy
    - EMG – muscle activity
    - Pedobarography – **pressure** mats
    - Metabolic - VO2, Efficiiency
- What is ground reaction force?
    - According to **Newton's third law** the so-called ground reaction force (GRF) is the force exerted by the ground on a body in contact with it.
