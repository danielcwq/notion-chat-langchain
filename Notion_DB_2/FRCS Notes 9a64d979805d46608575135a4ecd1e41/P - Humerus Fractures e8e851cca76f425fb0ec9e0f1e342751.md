## P - Proximal Humerus Fractures (❌)

- Classification of Paeds Proximal Humerus #?
    - Neer and Horwitz
    - Type 1 < 5mm displacement
    - 2 < 1/3 width of shaft
    - 3 = 2/3 of shaft width
    - 4 = > 2/3 shaft width
- ‼️ Why is there high threshold for surgery?
    - Proximal growth plate **responsible for 80% of growth** in humerus; remodelling potential is high
    
    ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled.png)
    
- Limits of displacement for surgery?
    - Dobbs et al. 2003 JPO published an algorithm with good outcomes with the below limits of displacement for conservative mx.
        - **< 7 yo** < 70 °
        - **8-11 yo** < 60 °
        - **> 12yo** < 45 °
- Management?
    - **Grade 1/2** = Non Op
    - Grade 3/4 = controversial based on age and extent of displacement = **CRPP**
- What approach if require to open?
    - Deltopectoral approach if need open.
- What are the potential blocks to reduction?
    - long head of biceps tendon

## P - Humeral Shaft Fractures (❌)

- Management by age?
    - < 3yo = Hanging cast
    - > 3yo = Sarmiento bracing
    - If op = TENS nail

## P - Distal Humerus Physeal Separation

- What kind of Salter Harris fracture is this?
    - If < 3yo = SH1; if > 3yo = **SH2** (With thurston holland fragment)
- What is differential?
    - LATERAL CONDYLE FRACTURE
- How do you differentiate this from the above differential?
    - **Age group**, Type of swelling, Direction of displacement (posteromedial in physeal separation), Radio-capitellum relationship
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%202.png)
        
- Key physical findings?
    - "FUSIFORM" swelling
- What are the key features on the XR?
    - “Radiocapitellar relationship is preserved”
- ‼️ What must you rule out in distal humerus physeal separation?
    - NAI
- Most common direction of displacement?
    - POSTEROMEDIAL [Like **supra con**]
    - This is opposed to POSTEROLATERAL seen in elbow dislocation
- How can you assess alignment intraoperative?
    - Chou et al. described to align the ulnar axis within the medial and lateral humeral line
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Chou et al. 2018 JPO case series of 13 patients utilising this technique. 1 patient developed varus
- Management?
    - Tip: "I will Treat this as a grade 3 Supracon" ➔ CRPP
- Complication?
    - 70% cubitus varus!
    - Neurovascular compromise is rare

## P - Supracondylar Fracture (‼️)

- Why fracture happen at this location?
    - Thinnest part between olecranon and coronoid fossa
- ‼️ Which direction is common and the **nerves** affected in Supracondylar fracture?
    - Depend on the direction of displacement
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - If Extension and **posterolateral** ➔ medial spike will injure **AIN**
    - If extension and **posteromedial** ➔ lateral spike will injure **radial** nerve
    - if flexion ➔ **ulnar** nerve
- Most common direction of supracondylar injury?
    - Extension and **posteromedial** displacement
- Most common nerve injury? Why apparent paradox?
    - AIN
    - Seeming paradox because most common is posteromedial, yet most common nerve is AIN ➔ reason is because most Posteromedial fractures don’t cause nerve injury.
- What is pucker sign? Significance?
    - **Proximal** fragment has **button hole** through the Brachialis muscle
    - Requires early reduction in OT. If delay, harder to reduce
- How do you reduce the pucker sign in the OT?
    - Will need **milking** manoeuvre
    - Prepare for mini open reduction through elbow crease
- XR - What lines are you looking at?
    - Anterior humeral line along anterior humeral shaft should bisect the capitellum
    - Baumann angle aka Humeral Capitellar angle [70 +/-10]
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%205.png)
        
        - = Angle between line parallel to longitudinal axis of humeral shaft and a line along the lateral condylar physis
- Classification of this injury?
    - Gartland’s with Wilkin’s modification (add of 2A and B subtype)
    - Type 1 = undisplayed
    - 2 = Displaced with intact posterior hinge
        - 2A = no rotation
        - 2B = rotated ➔ Pin
    - 3 = completely displaced with loss of posterior hinge; but **still have periosteum**
    - 4 = Periosteum torn (unable to see on XR) ➔ very unstable (intra-op diagnosis)
- ‼️ How will you reduce the supracon?
    - Inline **traction** 5 minutes
    - Oblique views to check lateral and medial column ➔ correct **varus/ valgus**
    - **Flex** and see anterior humeral line on lateral XR
    - **Pronate** if medial comminution, **Supinate** if lateral comminution
- How will you pin this supra con?
    - Set up - supine with II drum as table
    - Reduce fracture
    - Pinning principles are **2mm wires, divergent (>50% width of fracture), 2 cortices**
    - I will start with a capitellum entry point (as opposed to extra-articular entry point), Insert one wire towards far cortex
    - Insert another wire
    - Check stability
    - KIV add 3rd wire or cross wire
    - Post Op - back slab ➔ convert to case in 2/52 ➔ cast for 4/52 ➔ Off cast, remove pins in 6/52
- What if you perforate the olecranon fossa?
    - It is Ok
    - It is an established technique to do a trans-olecranon fossa four cortical purchase
    - Advantage is that it provides 4 cortices to enhance stability of the fixation
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%206.png)
        
- How do you insert medial pin if needed?
    - **Medial incision**, visualise ulnar nerve and ensure wire is on bone
    - **Extend the elbow** to allow ulna nerve to drop back
    - **Apex** of crossing must be above the fracture site
- When is a relative indication for medial wire?
    - if there is medial comminution
- Complications you warn parents about?
    - Pin related - infection, migration, nerve injury
    - Cubitus Varus (gunstock deformity) due to physeal arrest
    - Cubitus Valgus can also occur (3%)
- What do you do if POST op ulnar nerve palsy?
    - Iatrogenic injury ➔ bring back to OT, remove pins
- What is the BOAST guidelines for Supracon? Key points?
    - Re: Vascularity. Surgical management should be provided urgently when there is an absent radial pulse, clinical signs of impaired perfusion of the hand and digits, open injury or evidence of threatened skin viability.
    - Re: size of pin. 2mm diameter wires should be used, where possible, to achieve stability. Intraoperative assessment of satisfactory stability and clinical alignment should be performed and documented.

- What is your starting point for the lateral pin?
    - **Gottschalk 2012** et al. JPO biomechanics study found that capitellar starting point within cartilage analge of the capitellum is a more stiffer construct vs extra-articular direct starting point

- Evidence of size of pin in supracon Fracture?
    - **2mm stiffer than 1.6mm by Gottschalk 2012** et al. biomechanics study
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-12 at 2.36.09 PM.png](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Screenshot_2022-06-12_at_2.36.09_PM.png)

- Paeds Supracondylar Fracture - Evidence for 2 lateral vs Cross pin in ?
    - Biomechanical studies show that cross pinning is more stable than 2 lateral pins and even with 3 lateral pins. However, **Higher risk of ulnar nerve injury.** Thus in my practice I usually do 3 lateral pins
    - **David Skaggs** et al. JBJS 2001 retrospective review of 141 patients.
        - No difference in **fracture reduction/ maintenance** for 2 lateral vs cross pin.
        - Cross pins higher risk of ulnar nerve injury **7.7% vs 0%**
    - **Lewis et al.** JBJS 1994 Biomechanical studies shows 3 pins with 1 medial pin is biomechanically more stable, followed by 3 lateral pins then 2 pins.
- If well perfused but AIN palsy - is it indication for urgent surgery?
    - No
    - Barrett 2014 JBJS 2 et al. Retrospective study of 35 patients with AIN, mean op time 14 hours, all complete recovery in 49 days.

### SCENARIO 1 = PULSELESS WHITE HAND

- How will you manage this?
    - ATLS... WILL NOT ATTEMPT REDUCTION ... BACK SLAB
    - Based on the British BOAST guidelines, "this a **clinical sign of impaired vascularity** to the limb, thus an indication for urgent surgery"
    - Inform anaesthesia, standby vascular colleagues for surgery

### SCENARIO 2 = PINK PULSELESS HAND

- How will you manage this?
    - ATLS... WILL NOT ATTEMPT REDUCTION ... BACK SLAB
    - Based on the British BOAST guidelines point 3, this is an indication for emergency surgery regardless of fasting time ➔ RSI
    - Inform anaesthesia, vascular colleagues for P1 surgery

### SCENARIO 3 = POST OP PINK PULSELESS HAND

- Will you just monitor in PACU?
    - I will assess my reduction
    - If there is any doubts/ gaps ➔ risk of artery interposition at fracture site, low threshold to re-reduce and pin
    - OR if there is Pre-op median nerve palsy ➔ found to have higher risk of concomittant vascular injury ➔ low threshold to re-reduce
- How do you monitor?
    - In my institution, i monitor with the **Pulse oximetry,** look at waveform
    - This is based on a local study - Reuben et al. 2013 KKH paper retrospective study of 26 pulseless perfused hands
        - 22 patients with waveforms —> no Neurovascular compromise
        - 4 no waveforms —> underwent exploration with significant findings
- How long will you monitor for? Why that duration?
    - Maximum **6 hours** AFTER surgery
    - Warm ischemia time, prevent future Volksmann Contractures
    - What are the warm and cold ischemia times?
        - Distal to carpus < 12 hr, < 24 hr
        - Proximal to carpus < 6 hr, < 12 hr

### SCENARIO 4 = IMMEDIATE POST OP WHITE HAND

- How will you manage this?
    - This will be considered an iatrogenic or I have fixed the fracture while the artery is interposed in the fracture site
    - Immediately REMOVE pins and to reasses vascularity
    - If any doubt, to call vascular colleagues for on table exploration
- How do you explore the artery?
    
    [Elbow Approaches](Elbow%20Approaches%2014f38bf1954f47e6a3f5c697c93bceb7.md) 
    
    - Hoppenfield approach to cubital fossa distal limb is lateral, while medial limb goes proximally
    - AO trauma guide - A lazy S shaped incision with **distal limb medially (this is where Artery is)** - keep it small initially and to extend when necessary

### SCENARIO 5 = CHILD WITH CUBITUS VARUS

- How will you examine this child?
    - Look/ Move - scars, compared ROM (expect limited in flexion)
    - Feel - check stability, check for Neurovascular deficit from injury
- Causes of cubitus Varus?
    - Most common - supracondylar fracture
    - Others - **MHE**, Lateral condyle fracture with overgrowth
- If i tell you there is a lost of one ROM, what is it? Why?
    - Likely loss of flexion. because malunion in Supracon which is usually in extension, so will lose some flexion
- ⚠️ ⚠️ What is the classic deformity here?
    - Varus, Hyperextension and **internal rotation**
- What is the Yamamoto test?
    - It is a test for Internal rotation deformity at the supracondylar region described by Yamamoto in 1985
    - Patient stand flexed
    - Shoulder in full extension and passively internally rotate the shoulder
    - Normally, it is 0 °. If there is varus then it will have an increase

- 6 year old Parent ask if it will get worse or better
    - Usually remodel in plane of movement
    - So we dont expect this to remodel much
- Now they have a cubitus Varus deformity, what injury are they prone to now?
    - Lateral condyle fracture
- ‼️ What is a future complication from this deformity?
    - Chronic PLRI
    - Tardy Ulnar nerve palsy
- How does cubitus varus cause **PLRI**?
    - According to paper by O’driscoll, in 24 patineits
    - With cubitus varus, the mechanical axis, olecranon and triceps line of pull all place an external rotational torque, **stretching the lateral collateral ligament complex**, leading to PLRI
    - Found to only develop approximately **20 to 30 years** after deformity occured as it is a gradual attenuation of the LCL complex.

- How does cubitus varus cause **tardy ulnar nerve palsy**?
    - Ogino et al. in 1986 found that in these patients, the deformity results in the medial movement of the medial head of the triceps muscle
    - When the elbow is flexed, the triceps compresses on the ulnar nerve!

- What is the management?
    - Address all 3 deformities with a distal humerus osteotomy - consider a lateral closing wedge osteotomy
    - Need to translate the step cut medially to avoid lateral prominence

## P - Lateral Condyle Fracture

![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%208.png)

- What is a differential to this fracture?
    - Distal Humerus physeal separation
- ‼️ Why is this fracture hard to heal?
    - Tenuous blood supply from posterior!!
    - Intra-articular - Bathed in synovial fluid
    - Constant pull of common extensor muscles
- 2 MOI theory?
    - Pull off = varus stress leading to avulsion of lateral condyle
    - Push off = impaction of radial head onto lateral condyle
- How will you classify this?
    - Jakob - based on displacement
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%209.png)
        
        - Type 1 = **Hinge** = undisplaced
        - 2 = **Gap** = displaced with extension into articular surface
        - 3 = **Flip** = Completely displaced
    - Milch - based on location
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%2010.png)
        
        - Milch 1 = Through **capitellum ossification centre** (salter 4)
        - 2 = through trochlea (SAlter 2)
- Invx - special view?
    - Internal Oblique XR
- Management?
    - **< 2mm** = Non op
        - Based on Weiss et al. JPO 2009
    - **> 2mm** = Fix
        - Do I need to open? **If reduction can be achieved closed, proceed with CRPP/ Screw fixation**
            - Assess reduction by checking 3 lines
        - If cannot - may need to open and reduce under visualisation
        - Direct lateral approach between BR and triceps; avoiding posterior dissection (blood supply from posteriorly)
- How will you fix this fracture if > 2mm displaced? Approach? Fixation Choice? Buried?
    - "My goal of fixation is to attain reduction and stable fixation with minimal periosteal stripping especially **posteriorly** to preserve blood supply to the lateral condyle. "
    - I will first attempt closed reduction ➔ if successful, proceed with pinning
    - If not, Open reduction with a **DIRECT LATERAL APPROACH** (between **BR and triceps**)
        - Taking care not to dissect posteriorly (Avoid posterior dissection as supply is mainly posterior according to cadaveric studies by Yamaguchi et al. 1997 JBJS ➔ reason why we do not want to elevate posteriorly)
    - In my hands, my choice of fixation is that of **Percutaneous Pinning** though I am aware, one can also use screw fixation also with its advantages and disadvantages
        
        ![Untitled](P%20-%20Humerus%20Fractures%20e8e851cca76f425fb0ec9e0f1e342751/Untitled%2011.png)
        
        - I will use **2mm wires, divergent with 2 cortices**; possible putting one horizontal and one oblique pin
    - I will **choose not to bury pins**, though I am aware this is controversial
        - Not burying pins (+) = easy removal, (-) = risk of infection
        - Burying pins (+) = lower infection risk, (-) = need another surgery
        - Lester Chan et al. 2011 - no difference in infection rates, in exposed vs buried but exposed easier to remove - for **4 weeks only**
    - Benefits of bury?
        - “However, it is likely that unburied wires might be more prone to pin site infection and a after deep infection.
        - The duration of unburied fixation for reducing the probability of infection is about 4 weeks; however, a short duration of unburied fixation may provide inadequate time for secure union.
        - Conversely, buried K-wires can be left in place until surgeons have explicit radiographic evidence of fracture union.

- How do you do an arthrogram? Where do you inject?
    - Inject directly through the triceps into the olecranon fossa.
    - It is not possible to go laterally due to the joint being very narrow

- Must you open to reduce?
    - Ideally open because this is an intra-articular fracture that requires anatomic reduction
    - However, Closed reduction can be attempted but to assess articular congruity, one can do an arthrogram
        - If intact ➔ CRPP
        - If involved ➔ ORIF under visualisation
- CRPP with pin vs ORIF with screw? [KKH - uses only screws]
    - Cannulated screws have advantage of compression across fracture site
    - Stein et al. 2015 found higher rate of closed reduction, lower infection rate and earlier mobilisation with screw
    - Pennock et al. 2015 JPO For type Jakob or Weiss Type 2 with intact cartilage, no difference in outcome but shorter op time and no open incision for CRPP.
- ‼️ 3 Complications you are aware of?
    - **Fish tail deformity**
        - Mild **AVN of trochlea** laterally resulting in deepening of groove between capitella and trochlea

        - No functional impairment
    - **Lateral spurring from overgrowth**
        - Johanatan Pribaz et al. JPO 2012 73% have lateral spurring but **does not affect ROM**
    - **Valgus** deformity from arrest or **varus** from overgrowth
- When does cubitus valgus deformity occur?
    - SH Type 4 injury in a Milch type 1 lateral condyle fracture
    - Because Resting zone of the physis is disrupted, high risk of growth arrest ➔ cubitus valgus

## P - Medial Epicondyle Fracture

- What age does this occur? Why?
    - Usually 10-15 years old. Because it is the last to fuse at 17 years old
    - **CRITOE sequence at 1/3/5/7/9/11?**
        - Capitellum, Radial head, Internal (medial) epicondlyle, trochlea, olecranon, External (lateral) epicondyle
        - Closure sequence
            - 12 yo, E, C, T start to fuse together
            - 15 yo ECT fuse to humerus, O and R fuses
            - 17 yo medial condyle fuses
- What is it associated with?
    - Elbow dislocation
- What nerve injury must you look out for?
    - Ulnar nerve - 10-16% reported neuropraxia
- Special XR view?
    - Distal humeral axial view - beam angled 25 degrees anterior to long axis of humerus

- Management of medial epicondyle fracture?
    - Undisplaced **< 2mm** ➔ Conservative in above elbow cast
    - **Displaced > 2mm** ➔ Op
    - Indications for surgery: displaced > 2mm, incarcerated, large fragment
    - Aware that some studies show no differences in ROM, functional outcomes, return to sports despite being displaced by
- Approach to medial epicondyle fracture?
    - Direct Medial approach to medial epicondyle via inter-nervous plane between **Flexor pronator mass and brachialis (MCN) // Triceps (radial n.)**
        - Same but opposite approach to lateral condyle - direct lateral between brachialis and triceps

    - Identify and protect ulnar nerve
    - Due to the pull of the flexor pronator mass, can use esmarch technique to push the fragment proximally
- Fixation technique?
    - Screw vs wire vs Suture anchor
    - Kathleeen Ricket et al. JPO 2020
        - Screw construct strongest and stiffest
        - Screw fixation offers shorter casting duration but greater implant removal need with higher associated costs
- What is the SCIENCE study?
    - Surgery or Cast for Injuries of the EpicoNdyle in Children’s Elbows
