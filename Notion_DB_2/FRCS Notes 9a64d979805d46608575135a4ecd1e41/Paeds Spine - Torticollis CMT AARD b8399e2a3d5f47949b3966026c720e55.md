- How do you approach this case?
    - This is a clinical photo of a child with head tilted to one side
    - I would first like to determine is this is **painful or not.**
    - I want to take history, PE and do Invx
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Painful vs painless torticollis?
    - **Painful** - traumatic, AARD
    - **Painless** - CMT, **Syndromes like Klippel Feil** and non SCM causes (eye squint, vestibular)
- What are you looking for in history
    - **CMT** - since birth? traumatic delievery, breech?
    - **Klippel Feil** - history of syndromes
    - **Non scm** - any history of hearing issues/ vestibular issues
    - **[painful] AARD** - any recent infection, trauma

- What are the other packaging disorders? [Top to bottom]
    - Plagiocephaly
    - Congenital muscular torticollis
    - DDH
    - Posteromedial tibia bowing
    - Metatarsus Adductus
    - Calcaneovalgus foot

- Physical exam?
    - **Congenital Muscular Torticollis** - head is tilted to affected side, palpable neck mass (pseudotumor)
    - **Klippel feil** - **triad**, shoulder
    - **Non SCM**  - check hearing, head tracking to noise
    - **[painful] AARD** - head is tilted to normal side as SCM contracture is compensatory
    - Usually no neurology because Space Available for Cord is capacious. Unless traumatic - may have vertebral basilar syndrome with involvement of cerebella, brain stem
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What is the most common cause of torticollis?
    - Most common is CMT. 20% has DDH!
    - Other causes are **ABCDE**
        - A - AARD
        - Bony deformity - Klippel Feil
        - CMT
        - Dependant posture in smaller age group
        - Eye/ ear problems
- What investigation?
    - Depending on my suspicion
    - **CMT** - US to look for palpable mass in SCM
    - **AARD** - XR, Dynamic CT is gold standard
    - **Syndrome** - XR
    - **Non syndrome** - hearing tests, vestibular tests
    - If traumatic - may need CT angio TRO vertebral artery damage

### CONGENITAL MUSCULAR TORTICOLLIS

- Which direction does the head tilt?
    - Head rotates away from the tight SCM and tilts towards ipsilateral problem side
- What is the management?
    - Non operative is successul 90% in **first** year
        - Passive stretching
    - Do surgery by 3 years old.
- What surgical management? What nerve
    - **Unipolar** - Distal release (**preferred** as safer, further from SAN)
    - Bipolar release - Distal + proximal release
    - Z-plasty lengthening
    - Nerve in danger = Spinal accessory nerve (CN11) that supplies the SCM and trapezius

### ATLANTOAXIAL ROTATORY DISPLACEMENT (AARD)

- What is AARD?
    - It is a **fixed** rotation of C1 on C2 caused by subluxation or facet dislocation
- Which direction does the head tilt in AARD?
    - CMT - chin tilt to normal side
    - AARD - chin tilts to abnormal side. It is the contralateral SCM that contracts,
- What is the most common cause of AARD?
    - **Grisel** Syndrome (retropharyngeal irritation secondary to URTI)
    - Mechanism:
        - Direct connection between pharyngovertebral veins and peridontal venous plexues to suboccipital epidural sinuses ‚ûî Hematogenenous transport of peripharyngeal septic exudates to upper cervical spine
        - Regional lymphadenitis also causes spastic contractures of cervical muscles + abnormally loose ligaments ‚ûî subluxations of joints
- Other causes of AARD?
    - Grisel 35%
    - Trauma 25%
    - Recent head neck surgery 20%
    - Associated conditions
        - Down syndrome,
        - RA, AS,
        - Klippel Feil
- What will you see on Dynamic CT?
    - Fixed rotation of C1 on C2 which does not change with dynamic rotation
    - CT scan done first with head straight forward, and then in max rotation right and left
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What is the classification of AARD?
    - **Fielding and Hawkins**
    - Type 1 = unilateral facet sublux [Most common in paeds]
    - 2 = Unilateral Dislocation + TL injured (3-5mm anterior displacement)
    - 3 = Bilateral facet subluxation (> 5mm anterior displacement)
    - 4 = **posterior** displacement of atlas

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Management of AARD?
    - ‚ÄúBased on **duration** of symptoms‚Äù
    - **< 1 week** = soft collar, NSAIDS and stretching
    - **< 1 month** =
        - hospital vs home halter traction (5lbs);
        - muscle relaxants and analgesia
        - post reduction immobilization with soft collar
    - **1 month =**
        - attempt halter traction for 3 weeks in gradual increase in weight
        - post reduction halo vest immobilization for 6 weeks
    - **3 month or failure of previous management**
        - Surgery = C1/2 open reduction, posterior spinal instrumentation
- How do you do **Halter** traction?

    - A balanced traction for neck
    - Chin stype stirrup attached to cord
    - Head end is raised to allow body weight to provide counter traction
    - Can be done at home or hospital
    - Small amounts (5 pounds)
    - Do with muscle relaxants and analgesics
