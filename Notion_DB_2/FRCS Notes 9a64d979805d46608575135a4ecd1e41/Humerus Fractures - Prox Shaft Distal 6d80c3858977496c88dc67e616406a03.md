## Proximal Humerus Fractures ‼️

- What is the main blood supply to humerus head?
    - Posterior circumflex artery (travels with axillary nerve via quadrangular space)
- What investigation?
    - XR - AP, Axillary (or velpeau), Y-scapula
        
        ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled.png)
        
    - CT scan
- Why does XR look subluxated?
    - Due to deltoid atony, inhibition, hemathrosis
- How to you classify?
    - Neer’s classification
    - By definition, considered a part if displaced **> 1cm** or angulated **> 45 degrees**
    - Divided into
    - 1 part if minimally displaced
    - 2 part – either anatomical neck, surgical neck, GT or LT
    - 3 part – 2 fracture lines at neck and GT/ LT
    - 4 part = 3 fracture lines
- ‼️ What are the XR features that prognosticates AVN?
    - Based on hertel’s criteria
    - 1. Length of dorsomedial **metaphyseal extension** < 8mm
    - 2. Integrity of **metaphyseal hinge** = “Present if displacement of shaft in any direction greater than 2mm”
    - 3. **Anatomical neck** fracture
    - If all 3 present, **PPV 97%**
- Is it true AVN will occur even with above features?
    - No. Hertel et al.
    - **8 of 10 intraop ischemic heads (doppler and bore hole diagnosed) did not develop AVN** (after 6 years), indicating that revascularization may indeed occur

### 1. Elderly, comminuted # = **RTSA**

- "Elderly lady, high function, with communited proximal humerus fractures, features of high risk of AVN"
- How will you manage this patient? **P and I**
    - Management is based on Patient and injury factors
    - **Injury factors** comminuted, risk of AVN, risk of secondary OA. Surgical intervention is reccomended but likely replacement.
    - **HOWEVER**, understand that non operative management is also acceptable based on the PROPHER Trial
    - **Patient** factors - high function, dominant arm ➔ sway towards surgery to restore function
    - Thus, in this patient, my recommendation will be a replacement surgery if patient is fit.
- Options for replacement?
    - RTSA vs Hemiarthroplasty
    - The main difference is that HA requires the healing of tuberosity for it to function well. In view of this elderly patient with comminuted fracture, concerns of ***healing of tuberosity*** in osteoporotic bone.
    - Inclined towards RTSA
    - In addition, Recent analysis **Austin et al. JOT 2019** found that RTSA had better ROM, clinical outcomes and lower reoperation rates

- How does RTSA work?
    
    [Rotator Cuff Tears/ Arthropathy/ RC Issues](Rotator%20Cuff%20Tears%20Arthropathy%20RC%20Issues%20bb1099282d3d4ec29fc688f31027ec35.md) 
    

### 2. Young, communited # = **ORIF**

- "Young male, comminuted # even though features at risk of AVN, aware that 8/10 did not get AVN, will strill strive for fixation and to reserve replacement as salvage procedure"
- Options for fixation? When will you use a nail?
    - Nail vs plate
    - *"Can choose to use a nail for 2-3 part fractures for the advantage of smaller incision, early weight bearing. However, risks of RC tendonitis"*
    - Recent Meta-analysis JOT 2016 - found that significant poorer results when nails done in 4 parts fracture as compared to 2 and 3 part fractures
    - I will thus consider nails in minimally comminuted fractures.

- How will you surgically fix this fracture?
    - Pre Op
        - Appropriately counsel and consent patient for surgery
    - Intra op
        - Position - beach chair
        - Approach - deltopectoral pproach
        - Place Suture on Tuberosity fragments and rotator cuff tendons
        - Preliminary reduce, hold with K-wire
        - Assess need for **adjucts and augments** if poor bone stock -
            - Fibular strut graft
            - Acute shortening
            - medial buttress plating
        - Proximal humerus plate applied laterally
        - Aim for medial KICKSTAND calcar screw
        - Tie RC sutures down to plate
    - Post Op
        - Check Brachial plexus, MCN, Axillary nerves
        - Gentle PROM pendular exercises
        - Check XR at 6/52 before begining WB

- Evidence for Kick stand Screw?
    - **Gardner et al. JOT 2007**
    - Presence of inferomedial calcar screw had significant effect of magnitude of subsequent loss of reduction, loss of humeral head height and screw loosening.

### 3. Elderly for Non Op

- "Elderly lady, poor function, non dominant arm, for non operative management"

- What do you know about the PROPHER Trial?
    
    PROximal Fracture of the Humerus: Evaluation by Randomisation
    
    - Multicenter RCT of 250 patients, mean **age 66** of **displaced 2/3/4** part fractures
    - Primary outcome – **oxford shoulder score, SF-12, complications.**
    - No significant differences between both groups; no difference in revision rates at 2 year and 5 year
        
        ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - Criticisms -
        - 87 had “clear indication for surgery” and were not included in study
        - 66 surgeons involved (Heterogeneity)
        - 16/125 10% were randomised to surgery and did not receive surgery
    
    [PROPHER.pdf](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/PROPHER.pdf)
    

### 4. Fracture- Dislocation

![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%202.png)

- How will you manage this fracture-dislocation in the EMD?
    - Wei et al. classified fracture dislocation of the shoulder into 3 groups
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-10 at 12.00.45 AM.png](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Screenshot_2022-06-10_at_12.00.45_AM.png)
        
    - In this study,
        - all of group 1 were reducible in EMD
        - Group 2 - 80% successful (4/5)
        - Group 3 - None successful for group 3 (0 of 11)
    - Recommended algorithm:

- What will you do if this is a group 3 fracture?
    - I will not attempt closed reduction
    - Early CT scan overnight - available in my institution
    - List in trauma list as first case in AM and inform shoulder surgeon on call
- What will be the surgical plan?
    - Pre operative
        - Discuss with patient - ORIF vs RTSA taking into account age of patient
        - Fracture - high risk of AVN, 97% PPV of AVN with presence of anatomical neck #, short metaphyseal extension and medial hinge displacement
    - Intraop
        - Anterior deltopectoral approach
        - Identify tuberosity fragments with RC attached, apply stay sutures
        - ORIF = Reduce humeral head, Preliminary holding with K-wires, apply lateral proximal humerus plate, kick stand screw
        - Replace = remove humeral head, proceed to prepare glenoid and shaft
    - Post op
        - Monitor NV
- What is the mechanism of a fracture dislocation of shoulder?
    - By first principles, a fracture dislocation should not occur (either One or ligaments give way at one time)
    - For a fracture dislocation to occur, the shoulder joint first dislocates, then is attempts to reduce but this is prevented by the hill sachs lesion
    - With this impaction, combined with weak bone, a fracture then occurs.

## Humeral Shaft Fractures‼️

- Humeral Shaft Fractures - What is the prevalence of Radial nerve palsy?
    - Overall 11.8% based on **Shao 2005 Systematic Review**
    
    [shao2005.pdf](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/shao2005.pdf)
    
    - Holstein Lewis? 22% vs 8% (**Eklhom et al.)**
    
    [ekholm - holstein lewis2008.pdf](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/ekholm_-_holstein_lewis2008.pdf)
    
- Radial nerve palsy in the setting of OPEN humerus fracture
    - Case series by Robert Foster 1993 JHS
    - 14 patients with open humerus shaft fracture with radial nerve palsy
    - **64%** were lacerated or interposed between fracture fragments
    - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0363502393902552](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0363502393902552)
- What are the deforming forces?
    - If fracture is distal to pec ➔ adducted by pecs
    - If proximal to pec ➔ Abducted by deltoids
- ‼️ How does sarmiento bracing work?
    - Anterior and posterior shell held with vlecro
    - Fracture reduction via soft tissue compression and hydrostatic pressure against bone like a hydraulic cylinder, other principle is ?ligamentotaxis
    - Tighten **daily** with **weekly** follow up
    - Follow up for 6-8 weeks
- What are the contraindications to sarmiento bracing?
    - **Absolute** Indications– vascular injury, palsy after reduction
    - Relative indications - Patient and Injury factors
    - **Patient** Factors - obese, pendulous breast, non compliance
    - **Injury** factors - segmental, bilateral, floating elbow, Limits 20/20/2cm, transverse fracture (theoretically lower surface area), VAS
    - Open fracture is not an absolute contraindication for bracing

- What is the outcome of sarmiento bracing?
    - In Sarmiento original paper of 620 patients, only 2% had non union
        
        [sarmiento paper.pdf](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/sarmiento_paper.pdf)
        
    - However more recent study - **FISH Trial in JAMA 2020** (Finnish Shaft of Humerus)
        - RCT of 80 patients between plate and bracing
        - No difference in functional outcomes at 12 months BUT higher risk of Non union with bracing **(25% vs 8%!)**
        
        [FISH Trial.pdf](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/FISH_Trial.pdf)
        
- What will you ask the patient to do daily on this brace?
    - Daily exercises ➔ muscle contraction will improve alignment
- Can you treat humeral shaft fracture in patient with brachial plexus conservatively?
    - No. Because there sarmiento brace requires the function of the UL muscles to provide hydrostatic pressure to maintain reduction.

- Humeral Shaft Fracture Plate or Nail better?
    - **Cochrane review 2011** – Similar union rates, Nailing had increased risk of shoulder pain; nails more frequently removed
    - Nail – immediate WB, smaller wound, not for presence of palsy.
    - [https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005959.pub2/abstract](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005959.pub2/abstract)
- What is the difference between the older and generation humeral nails?
    - Previous had lateral entry point - goes through cuff. but now with medial entry point preserves the SS tendon foot print
        
        ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - The medialization of the proximal part of the nail within the humeral head
        1. preserves a larger amount of bony substance lateral to the nails rim (“lateral bony bridge”), 
        2. additionally increasing the constructs capability to resist varus displacing forces

### 1.  PRE reduction palsy

- ‼️ How will you manage this patient with radial nerve palsy on arrival in humeral shaft patient?
    - Management based on Patient and Injury factors. Palsy is not an absolute indication for surgery and it can be treated expectantly - according to Ekholm et al. 2008, **89% will experience complete recovery"**
    - **Patient** factors - hand dominance, function, obesity, pendulous breasts?
    - **Injury** factors - transverse type (lower surface area), 20/20/2 displacement, location of # (distal will have alot of deforming forces)
    - In view of these factors, I will consider surgical fixation
- Which method of fixation? Nail or plate?
    - "traditionally this will preclude a nail"
    - Not nail because nerve may be entrapped in fracture site
    - Unless separate inicsion is done to visualize and protect nerve, but it will defeat one advantage of nail which is its minimal invasiveness.
- What approach if ORIF?
    - As there is radial nerve palsy, obliged to approach posteriorly to identify and protect the nerve throughout surgery
    - Document which screw hole radial nerve sits on
- ‼️ Post op what will you monitor? How will you monitor for nerve recovery?
    
    “Based on Shao et al., 89% spontaneously recover. No consensus on optimal follow up. As such, I will watch out for features of reinnervation clinically (advancing tinel) and neurodiagnostic testing (polyphasic wave forms)”
    
    - 1. Monitor for bone healing
        - Serial XR, watch for callus, radiological and clinical union
    - 2. Monitor for nerve healing
        - "There are no established guidelines to monitor for nerve recovery. "
        - Exam spill:
            - *“I will monitor clinically with progressive Tinel’s sign (understanding that reinnervation begins at ECRB and last being the EIP).*
            - *US at **3/52** when swelling reduced to check for continuity. (as per Shao et al.)*
                - ***If not continuous** ➔ Extricate kiv nerve graft*
                - ***If continuous**, continue monitoring ➔ with NCS EMG at **3/12** to differentiate neuropraxia or axonotmesis*
                    - *If neuroparaxia - continue monitoring*
                    - *If wallerian degeneration has occured ➔ consider nerve grafting if motor end plates still intact or tendon grafting if motor end plates degenerated (> 9/12)*
        - **Shao et al JBJS 2005** - consider nerve US when swelling reduced at 3/52 to evaluate if nerve is in continuity. entrapped/ severed - however this is operator dependant and requires a skilled ultrasounographer and dependant on institution availability.
        - In my practice, i will Monitor clinically by the "progressive tinel sign" - 1mm/ day
        - Understand that the PIN nerve supply the extensor muscles of the forearm, first being the ECRB with the last being EIP
        - If progressive - continue to monitor
        - If no progress, to do NCS EMG at about 3 months. To differentiate Neuropraxia vs Neurotmesis ➔ if any concern, to refer to nerve surgeon
        
        ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%204.png)
        
- ‼️ What are you looking for on NCS and EMG that suggest neural REGENERATION?
    - EMG = **polyphasic** units
    - NCS = confirms no neurotmesis - presence of conduction
- ‼️ What will NCS and EMG show if neurotmesis and no progress?
    - EMG = **fasciculations** at rest
    - NCS = no conduction at all
- Why do nerve assessment only at 3 months?
    - Allow time to differentiate neuropraxia vs neurotmesis

### 2. POST reduction palsy

- What will you do if palsy after reduction?
    - Immediate **reverse the maneuver** and recheck
    - if unable to attain suitable reduction without palsy ➔ indication for surgery

### 3. Previous humeral shaft #, chronic Radial nerve palsy

- What is the salvage for radial nerve palsy?
    - Can consider nerve transfer if < 6 months; end plates still intact
    - if > 9 months may need Tendon transfer

## Distal Humerus Fractures

- What is the anatomy of the distal humerus?
    - Described as having **2 columns** with a **tie arch connecting the 2**
        
        ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%205.png)
        
- Incidence of radial nerve palsy in distal humerus fractures?
    - Rare but reported especially in posteromedial displacement of distal articular fragment.
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-11 at 9.33.25 AM.png](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Screenshot_2022-06-11_at_9.33.25_AM.png)
        
    - Most recover
    - Can explore thru fracture site from intermuscular septeum down to radiocapitellar joint anteriorly
- Classification for Distal Humerus fractures?
    - AO Trauma - 1. 3
    - A = extra-articular
    - B - partial articular
    - C = complete articular
- Investigations?
    - XR, CT Scan
- Definitive management options for distal humerus fractures?
    - ORIF
    - Bag of bones in low demand, ill patients
    - Total Elbow Replacement
- What are your goals for treatment?
    - Goals of treatment is to achieve a pain free, stable joint with reduced articular surface to reduce the risk of secondary OA and to allow early ROM, blood supply preserving approach
- What is your approach and strategy?
    - This is complex intra-articular fracture - olecranon osteotomy approach
    - Anatomically reduce the articular joint surface
    - Fix the articular block to the shaft with K-wires, Fix on plates
    - If plan for replacement, cannot do Osteotomy. Instead, to Bryan morrey/ TRAP or triceps sparing approach
- What is your approach?

- Distal Humerus Fractures - What is your plating strategy?
    - There is no consensus on the optimal plating configuration with studies advocating for both parallel plating vs octagonal plating (medial side is constant at the epicondyle)
        
        ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Parallel plating
        - Odriscoll 8 principles –
            - 6 screw factors -
                1. As many as possible  
                2. As Long as possible
                3. As Many fragments as possible
                4. Catch far fragments
                5. Interdigitate
                6. Every screw pass through plate
            - 2 Plate factors
                1. Stiff plates
                2. Compression configuration
        - (+) : Ability to withstand varus stress (tension side) especially when shoulder is abducted during "apparently minimal-use activities"
    - Octagonal Plating
        - (+): Better torsional resistance
        - (-) More soft tissue stripping onto posterior aspect ➔ Main blood supply of lateral humerus is posterior (Yamaguchi et al. 1997 JBJS)
    - **Definitive indications for octoganal plating** = coronal shear fractures of capitellum
- Other plating considerations?
    - Try to be different length to prevent stress riser. Usually the medial side is longer (the down side is that you have to really push the ulnar nerve out of the way)
- Aware of any evidence for either plating strategy?
    - **Biomechanical studies** are conflicting -
        - Biomechanical studies JHS 2012 by Christopher Got - Perpendicular plating greater torque to failure, but no difference in AP stiffness
            
            ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%207.png)
            
        - JSES 2011 Charamlampos - parallel higher stiffness than 90/90; Parallal higher ultimate torque
            
            ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%208.png)
            
    - **Clinical comparison** by Sand-Jin et al. in JSES 2010 - no significant difference in ROM, nonunion or complications
        
        ![Untitled](Humerus%20Fractures%20-%20Prox%20Shaft%20Distal%206d80c3858977496c88dc67e616406a03/Untitled%209.png)
        

- Will you transpose the ulnar nerve?
    - Higher risk of neuritis with routine transposition (Chen et al.) – **33% vs 9%**
    - Cohort study of 89 patients found that incidence of ulnar neuritis was 33% in transposition group comparted to 9% in non transposition. Do not reccomend routine transposition

    - I will assess intraoperatively to look for excessive friction over medial implant
- What are the types of ulnar nerve transposition?
    - **Subcutaneous**
    - **Intramuscular** - a gutter is cut into the flexor pronator muscle group and nerve placed in the gutter then fascia sutured over the nerve
    - **Submuscular** - release flexor pronator muscle group from medial epicondyle, transpose nerve under and re attach muscles
- Post op rehabilitation?
    - No need back slab; immediately allow FROM
- Post op considerations?
    - HO prophylaxis - classically indomethacin 75mg OM 6 weeks
    - However, recent literature suggest that selective Cox2 inhibitors also have similar efficacy and are more gastrointestinal friendly

- Considerations if you KIV TEA in a very comminuted elderly fracture?
    - If planning to ORIF KIV TEA intraop, need to use extensor mechanism sparing approaches such as the Alonso Llames approach. Cannot do olecranon osteotomy.
        - It is true that TEA requires a small olecranon osteotomy but it is not the same level as a OO approach

- TEA vs ORIF in elderly patient?
    - Elderly **> 65 yo**, may be benefit in TEA
    - **McKee et al. JSES 2009 RCT** of ORIF vs TEA;
        - TEA Superior to ORIF as measured by DASH scores.
        - TEA shorter Op time, Trend towards reduced Reop Rate and improved ROM in TEA group.

- Role of distal humeral hemiarthroplasty?
    - First reported in the 1970s
    - Advantage over TEA - allows more weight bearing, preserves ulna bone stock, can allow TEA as salvage, can be used for younger more functional patients
    - Hemi vs TEA for elderly - ROM and function better for Hemi

### Capitellum Fractures

- What is the classification of capitellum fractures?
    - **Bryan Morrey**
    - Type 1 = Large osseous piece
    - Type 2 = Shear of cartilage only
    - Type 3 = Comminuted ++ = Broberg Morrey Fractures
    - Type 4 = Capitellum + trochlea

- What is the management?
    - ORIF if displaced Type 1, 4
    - Excise if comminuted (type 3) or displaced Type 2
- What is your approach for isolated capitellum fractures?
    - Lateral!
    - Avoid posterior dissection as supply is mainly posterior according to cadaveric studies by Yamaguchi et al. 1997 JBJS
        - Also the same reason why we do not want to elevate posteriorly in paeds lateral condyle fractures
- Significance in the setting of a distal humerus fracture?
    - May necessitate a orthogonal plating to allow screws to catch this capitellar fragment
