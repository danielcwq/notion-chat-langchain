- What is the histology in frozen shoulder?
    - Similar to Dupuytren's disease with **myofibroblasts** proliferation and collagen deposition and contracture
- ‼️ Short Case Extra points for frozen shoulder?
    - Look at hands for Dupuytrens! 50% of Frozen shoulder has Dupuytren!
    
    [The association between frozen shoulder and Dupuytren's disease - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11307078/)
    
    - 52% of patients with frozen shoulder had dupuytren. Only 3 had moderate to severe disease causing fixed joint contractures
    - Dupuytren disease is 8.27 times more common in patients with frozen shoulder

- Frozen Shoulder - Any evidence for MUA vs Arthroscopic capsular releases vs PT?
    - [UK FROST Trial in the Lancet 2020.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31965-6/fulltext) Multicenter RCT of 914 patients randomised to MUA, arthroscopic release vs Physiotherapy. None of the 3 interventions were clinically superior at **6 and 13 months** for Oxford Shoulder Score
    - More complications with surgery

- Sequence of MUA in frozen shoulder?
    - FEAR
    - Flexion, Extension, Abduction, External ROTATION
- What is hydrodilatation?
    - AKA distension arthrography
    - Done under II, needle insrted into GHJ and mixture of normal saline, steroids, and radio-opaque dye and LA can be given

- Which direction of winging is what?
    - Medial winging = weakness of Long thoracic nerve
    - Lateral winging = weakness of Rhomboids (Dorsal scapular) or trapezius (SAN)
- If patient has shoulder pain and short onset of winging?
    - Parsonage Turner Syndrome (Brachial Neuritis)
- ⚠️ B**ilateral winging with drooping eye lids?**

    - Fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy
    
- What are the causes of isolated winging?
    - Compressive nerve neuropathy - soft tissue,  tumor, cyst
    - Trauma with injury to nerve
    - Infection
