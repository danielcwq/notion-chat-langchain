### Femoral Head fracture (#‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è )

<aside>
üí° **Mx Goal-** get a pain free functional hip and prevent risk of secondary OA
**Mx -** Principles is to achieve **anatomical** reduction and **absolute** stability across fracture site to allow **early ROM**

    - Type 1 = Below Fovea
    - Type 2 = Above Fovea (WB surface)
    - Type 3 = Any Head # with Femoral neck #
    - Type 4 = Any head # with Acetabular #
- How do you manage definitively?
    - **Excise/ Fix/ Replace**
    - **Type 1** = No clear consensus but excision seems to give better outcomes than non op
    - **Type 2** = ORIF with headless screw
    - **Elderly** ‚Äì consider replacement
- What is your approach to fix the femoral head fracture?
    - Options. No consensus on the best approach
        - **Anterior** smith Paterson - Some authors say contraindicated to protect the remaining blood supply anteriorly
        - **Posterior** Kocher Langenback
        - **Trochanteric Flip Osteotomy** = anterior hip dislocation via posterior approach
    - I will use the posterior kocher langenback approach to address the acetabulum fracture and the trochanteric flip osteotomy to dislocate the hip anteriorly to prevent further damage to remaining blood supply for the following reasons:
    - 1. Prevents further damage to remaining blood supply
    - 2. Allows combination with kocher langenback approach to fix acetabulum
- Tell me about the trochanteric flip osteotomy?
    - Preserves the the deep branch of the MCFA
    - Hip is **dislocated anteriorly** after making GT osteotomy and retracting it anteriorly and incising the anterioinferior joint capsule
    - Do not excise obturator externus tendon to protect MFCA
    - [Hip + Pelvis Approaches](Hip%20+%20Pelvis%20Approaches%207fa0baff5c5e4ef88e58e0f9ff20553f.md)
- Any difference in rates of AVN for either approaches?
    - Giannnoudis et al. 2019 Both trochanteric flip and anterior approach no difference in AVN rates
- What are the Complications?
    - Heterotopic Ossification ‚Äì higher in anterior approach. Prophylaxis with indomethacin 75mg OM 6/52

### Neck of Femur Fracture

- Trabecular groups of the proximal Femur
    - There are 5 trabecular groups -
    - Ward's triangle is the confluence of these groups, which is an area of weakness where fracture can propagate.

- #üìú Management of elderly hip fracture?
    - **MDT** with geriatrics
    - Analgesia ‚Äì KIV nerve block
    - DVT prophylaxis as per NICE guidelines
        - NICE 2018 ‚Äì Clexane 12 h before and after; continue 1 month; calf pumps
- When will you do surgery for elderly hip fractures?
    - Based on meta-analysis by Lorenzo et al. on 190,000 patients in 2012 - Ideally less than 48 hours. Early hip surgery associated with lower risk of death and pressure sores
    
    ![Untitled](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Untitled%202.png)

- What is the mortality rates after a elderly hip fracture?
    - Singapore study - index admission rates 5.7%, 1 year mortality - 26%!
- How soon do you want to operate on this patient?
    - Based on the NICE guidelines, I will want to perform the surgery within 24 hours
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-07-24 at 5.28.48 PM.png](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Screenshot_2022-07-24_at_5.28.48_PM.png)
        
    - Understanding that, based on the **US National Trauma Data Bank, surgery after 48 hours of admission** is associated with increase in mortality and complication rate - 2 times the odds for mortality, ARDS, AMI, Pneumonia, severe sepsis or ICU stay
        - 
        
        [Debate Update: Surgery After 48 Hours of Admission for Geriatric Hip Fracture Patients Is Associated With Increase in Mortality and Complication Rate: A Study of 27,058 Patients Using the National Trauma Data Bank - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33993177/)
        

### SCENARIO: OLD UNDISPLACED NOF # (#‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è )

- How will you manage surgically an **undisplaced** NOF#? Evidence?
    - Fixation
    - Martyn Parker et al. 2008, retrospective analysis of 345 patients. found shorter op time, shorter ward stay, lower complications, lower 1 year mortality for fixation! But possible higher rates of reoperation.
        
        ![Untitled](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Thus, I will favour fixation if < 80. If > 80, in so called "super-aged", studies show lower post op complications, lower reop and better functional recover. (Qifeng et al. RCT of 78 patients)

- What device will you use for undisplaced NOF #?
    - Systematic reviews show no difference between the 2 implant choices
        
        [ma2018.pdf](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/ma2018.pdf)
        
    - However, based I can make a decision based on the Liporace paper
    - ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Frank Liporace JBJS 2008** study of 76 Pauwel 3.
        - Nonunion rate for CS was 19%
        - Fixed angle device was 8%.
        - Though not significantly different, it suggests fixed angle device is more suitable for more vertical fractures

### SCENARIO: OLD DISPLACED NOF # (#‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è )

- How will you manage?
    - Elderly, displaced hip, high risk of AVN ‚ûî Replace

- Hemi or Total? Evidence for your decision?
    - My decision will be based on the UK NICE Guidelines
        - Walking stick, Comorbids, Mental cognition
        
        ![Untitled](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - HOWEVER, I am aware of recent studies that show that there is no difference between the 2 especially in more elderly patients
    - **HOPE-Trial from Sweden compared for Octogenarians**
        - RCT of 120 octogenarians found no difference in outcomes, hip function after HA vs THR at 2 years.
        
        [Hope trial.pdf](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Hope_trial.pdf)
        
    - **HEALTH study in NEJM** - 1496 patients > 50 years old. No difference in revision rates. Found that THR had "clinically unimportant" improvement over HA in function and QOL (questionaire) over 2 years.
        
        [HEALTH study.pdf](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/HEALTH_study.pdf)
        
    - **Bhandari's Meta-analysis on THR vs Hemi** of 3084 patients found similar revision rates,function, mortality, periprosthetic fracture and dislocation at 5 years.
        
        [meta THR vs hemi.pdf](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/meta_THR_vs_hemi.pdf)
        
- What approach to replace this fractured hip?
    - Based on NICE guidelines ‚ûî **Lateral hardinge** approach, gluteus medius splitting approach
    - Some people do the posterolateral approach. But based on the Kwon et al. systematic review in 2006, comparable dislocation rates if you do soft tissue repair after the posterior approach.
- What is your choice of implant?
    - I will use a **cemented** taper-slip implant and if THR, a hybrid fixation. Reason is based on:
        - Nice guidelines mention CEMENTED with a ‚Äúproven femoral stem design‚Äù which i will use stryker exeter with a ODEP of 15A* [orthopaedic data evaluation panel] - 15 years in use, grade A evidence, replacement rate of less than 5% at 10 years
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-07-14 at 9.54.38 AM.png](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Screenshot_2022-07-14_at_9.54.38_AM.png)
            
        - Norwegian Hip Fracture Register which found overall higher reoperation risks for any reason for uncemented Hemiarthroplasty, higher risk of periprosthetic fracture and infection.
        - Australian Registry - For THR, also lower revision rates than uncemented for hybrid in fracture cases
- Composite Beam vs Taper Slip?
    - I will choose **taper slip** because this is what i am trained in
    - Aware that both stem philosophies have **shown excellent results in several European registries**, but their modes of failure might differ
        - Composite beam - aseptic loosening
        - Taper Slip - slightly higher risk of periprosthetic fracture
    - But overall, NJR showed a significant survival advantage of the most popular taper-slip design over all other groups of patients. (97.9% vs 97.5%) - practically the same..

    - Type 1 = < 30
    - 2 = 30-50
    - 3 > 50
- How will you proceed with closed reduction?
    - I will put into traction and apply a light rotation; usually this is sufficient to reduce the fracture
    - However, if it does not reduce, I will consider the Leadbetter Maneuver
- What is the Leadbetter maneuver?
    - FATTI CAR = Flexion, Abduction, Traction with IR.
- How can you check it is reduced? 3 tests
    - **1. Heel- Palm test** ‚Äì leg will not spontaneous ER in palm
    - **2. Lowell's alignment theory** outline of femoral head and neck junction on AP and Lateral should produce a S or reverse S and not a C

- What approach will you use for open reduction?
    - Anterior Smith Peterson Approach
    - Other option is to use an Watson's anterolateral approach so that there will be one incision

    - OR DHS
    - OR FNS
    - **Frank Liporace JBJS 2008** study of 76 Pauwel 3.
        - Nonunion rate for **CS was 19%** but **fixed angle device was 8%.**

    - aka "trochanteric neck screw" - it is **lag** screw from GT to neck
    - Transverse (Pauwel's) screw passing perpendicular to the fracture line into the infero-medial portion of the femur head resisting shear forces.
    - Pauwell screw configuration vs parallel screw configuration - 70% stiffer in cadaveric biomechanical studies

- Role of capsulotomy?
    - No consensus. Theory is to decompress tamponade effect of the hematoma
- Will you rush the patient into theatre? What is the evidence for timing?
    - No consensus in literature. As such, I will ensure lead trauma surgeon is available for surgery and plan it in the next day elective list.

    - No, time to surgery is not a prognosticating factor for AVN as shown by Upadhayay RCT found that surgery done < 48 or > 48 hours no difference. Martyn parker meta analysis in 2005 also found no diff < 12 or > 12 hr
    - What prognosticates is the **quality of reduction**
- What are the poor prognostic factors in Young NOF #?
    - Duckworth et al. JBJS 2011 - **Comorbids** like pre-existing renal, liver or respiratory disease; alchohol use.
    - Upadhyay et al. - **Comminution and reduction quality** affected prognosis but not time to surgery
- What is the overall risk of AVN in young NOF?
    - Upadhyay et al. - overall incidence was **16.3%**
- How will you place the screws?
    - > 5mm from subchondral bone
    - Above LT to avoid stress riser

### SCENARIO: PREVIOUS NOF # ‚ûî Nonunion or AVN

- How many of them will develop AVN?
    - Slobogean, Bhandari et al. Meta-analysis 2015 Overall reop rate 18%, non uinion 9%, AVN 14%
    - Most of patients with AVN have segmental AVN without collapse. Only 20% of patients with AVN require intervention ‚ûî usually THR (Nikolopoulos et al. Injury)
        
        [nikolopoulos2003.pdf](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/nikolopoulos2003.pdf)
        
- How will you evaluate this nonunion?
    - CT scan
    - MRI to look for AVN
- What are your options for salvage in non union?
    - TRO infection, AVN
    - Re-fixation vs Replacement (do not mention arthrodesis)
    - Re-fix if no AVN. Options:
        - Angle blade plate with more bony purchase
        - Valgus intertrochanteric osteotomy to correct varus and to reduce shear forces at fracture site.
        - **"Triple attack"** - Bone graft, valgus osteotomy, fixed angle plate

### SCENARIO: NECK + SHAFT # (#‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è )

- What implant configuration?
    - No consensus on single vs dual implant. No difference in AVN, nonunion rates. However, **Bhandari systematic review in 2003** found weak evidence from case series suggest **dual implants** may result in **fewer reoperations**
    - Priority is to achieve anatomical neck reduction and absolute stability at the neck fracture using a **Dynamic Hip Screw**, followed by relative stability fixation of the femoral shaft using a **retrograde nail**
- What is your fixation technique?
    - **Neck fixation**
        - Traction table, draping the groin
        - Closed reduction, low threshold for open using Smith paterson Approach (TFL // Sartorius)
        - Anatomical reduction, fix with DHS using separate lateral approach
        - DHS - 2 proximal screws, leaving 2 distal screw holes empty
    - **Shaft fixation**
        - Transfer to supine position on radioluscent table
        - Proceed with retrograde nail, ensuring overlap with DHS
        - Continue to insert the 2 distal screws

### Intertrochanteric Fracture

- How to classify IT Fractures?
    - Stabllity
        - Stable
        - Unstable = (reverse oblique, subtroch extension, transtroch, loss of medial calcar, loss of lateral buttress)
    - Number of parts = Evan Jansen
        - Type 1 = undisplaced
        - 2 = 2 displaced fragment
        - 3 = 3 part with GT fragment
        - 4 = 3 part with LT fragment
        - 5 = 4 part fracture
    - AO Classification
        
        ![Untitled](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Untitled%2017.png)
        
        - 3 (femur) 1 (proximal) A1 = stable; A2 = unstable; A3 = reverse oblique, transtrochanteric
    - Acute mx
- Any role of acute temporizing traction?
    - No evidence for traction in Cochrane reviews 2011 Martyn parker et al. ‚Äì does not improve pain relief, ease of fracture reduction or quality of fracture reduction
    
    ![Untitled](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Untitled%2018.png)
    

- DHS vs PFNA?
    - I am aware that the PFNA is Theoretical biomechanically more stable due to:
        - 1. **shorter moment arm** and thus more suited for unstable A3 fractures.
            
            ![Untitled](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Untitled%2019.png)
            
        - 2. **Higher torsional and bending rigidity** as SMA, PMA proportionate to power of 4 of radius compared to power of 3 of the thickness of plate
    - However, not conclusive in literature whether it impacts clinical outcomes
        - For example, Martyn Parker 2018 Meta-analysis in Injury Journal found comparable fracture healing and complication rates for A3 fractures (reverse oblique and transtroch) between DHS and IM Nail!
            
            [Art_Parker M- Nail or plate fixation for A3 trochanteric hip fractures.pdf](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Art_Parker_M-_Nail_or_plate_fixation_for_A3_trochanteric_hip_fractures.pdf)
            
    - However, In my practice, for unstable fractures as described by JAAOS ten tips paper Hadikewych - Reverse oblique, transtroch, subtroch extension, loss of lateral buttress, loss of medial calcar ‚ûî IM device
        - But I will take into consideration risk of the unique complication of cut in - whereby the stiffness of the implant results in cutting through of the osteoporotic bone into the head and acetablum
        - So in DHS, i aim TAD < 25 based in Baumgartner 1995 paper, but for Nail, I aim TAD 20-30
- How does the DHS fail in reverse oblique?
    - Draw and explain failure by shear stresses. Shear stresses > stiffness of implant
    - Loss of lateral buttress support, proximal fragments continus to slide unstopped.

- Tell me about Baumgartner Paper?
    - Study of 198 fractures, found to have 19 failures. 16 were due to cut out. Average TAD was 24mm for healed fractures, compared to 38mm for failures. None of the screws with TAD < 25mm cut out.

- Any difference Left vs Right side in your technique?
    - Left side has increased risk of malreduction when tightening the DHS screw
    - Left side rotational torque causes and anterior spike
    - Solution - insert holding wire OR to reverse turn towards the end

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è¬† ‚ö†Ô∏è  How do you choose between Short or Standard barrel?
    - I will choose a short barrel if the screw is < 85mm in length to allow sufficient collapse and sliding of the fracture site
        - Thread length is default 22mm
        - Aim is to allow sliding distance of at least 25mm
        - In order for this, the shortest length the standard barrell (38mm) can accomodate is a 85mm screw (**25 + 22 + 38 = 85mm** )
        - if shorter, then we should use short barrel which is 25mm
    - So, the standard barrel can accomodate a screw length of **25 + 22 + 38 = 85mm** screw. If the screw is shorter, then the sliding length will be less than 25mm.
    - Threads should capture as much distal bone as possible but threads should cross fracture line to allow compression ‚ûî **Choose long threads unless it crosses fracture line**
    - **Longer barrel offers a longer lever arm** to resist bending and thus less friction to sliding ‚ûî choose long unless barrell crosses fracture line and prevents sliding
    
    ![Untitled](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Untitled%2023.png)
    
- How do you choose 135/ 150 angle?
    - By looking at the native neck shaft angle
- What angulation must you avoid?
    - Avoid VARUS angulation because this will:
        - 1. Increase moment arm on the fixation
        - 2. Results in DHS screw to be higher in the head ‚ûî higher risk of cut out
        - 3. Resolving the forces will lead to more bending force than compression forces.
- Will you routinely use a long nail?
    - Some authors advocate the use of Long nails to prevent stress risers. However, long nails, lead to longer surgery times, more blood loss.
    - A local study by Andrew Hong et al. Did not find any difference in clinical and functional outcomes of patients treated with long and short nails. However, longer op duration and estimated blood loss.

- Role of Cement Augmentation in IT Fractures?
    - In in-vitro studies biomechanical studies, PMMA increases load to failure by 12-37%
    - No consensus for routine cement augmentation
    - Kammerlander et al. 2018 in Injury, Multicenter RCT. No increased complications
    - I will consider if patients have significant Co-morbids that affect bone density e.g. renal osteodystrophy, severe osteoporosis..

- How do you manage blade cut in/ through?
    - Management of this complication is based on patient and injury factors
    - P - still mobile, active ‚ûî have to address it
    - I - depends if united or not.
    - Options = **Replace or Re-fixation**
        - My options are removal and refixation with a **angle blade plate**
        - OR replacement with a total hip implant with length bypassing the most distal screw by at least 2 cortical widths
    - How will you do a replacement?
    - This will be a complex primary - pre, intra, post
    - Pre op - template, CT scans, check length of implant required; stand by long cemented stems and calcar replacement stems
    - Intraop - EEERR
        - E - posterior extensile
        - E - explant the implant
        - ER - examine and reconstrcut the calcar if required
        - R - replace with long stem cemented.
    - Post op Rehab - fwbat
- What are the principles in REPLACEMENT in IT fracture fixation failure?
    - Will not be using a primary stem but a **revision stem with or without calcar replacement**
    - Will need to have **distal purchase**
    - This will be either a long cemented or long cementless stem

### Subtrochanteric Fractures/ AFF

- What are the Deforming forces?
    - Proximal fragment is Abducted, ER, and Flexed by iliopsoas, external rotators
    - Distal fragment is adducted and shortened by adductors
- What is defined as a subtrochanteric fracture?
    - Based on UK NICE Guidelines, it is 5cm of bone distal to the lesser trochanter
    - [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs16/chapter/Quality-statement-5-Subtrochanteric-fracture](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs16/chapter/Quality-statement-5-Subtrochanteric-fracture)

- How do you classify this fracture?
    - Historically - Russell Taylor Classification - based on involvement of piriformis fossa (historically used to differentiate # that amenable to IM nail w piriformis entry vs plate)
        - 1 = piriformis fossa entry not involved
        - 2 = piriformis fossa involved
    - Number of parts ‚Äì **Seinsheimer**

        - 5 = subtroch with GT extension
- What history will you ask?
    - Ask for prodromal pain
    - Contralateral pain ‚Äì for prophylactic nailing
- What traction will you place for patient?
    - Hamilton Russell Traction - draw!
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è **What are the surgical considerations for the subtrochanteric fracture?** [Revised]
    
    6 considerations
    
    1. **Positioning** - lateral or traction table
    2. **Implant** choice - based on NICE guidelines - long IM nail
    3. Overcoming of **deforming** forces - with tools such as ball spike pusher, schanz pin and cerclage wires, colinear clamps
    4. Starting point - aim to prevent varus as well as **Overcoming bowed** femur 
        1. Especially in asians and in osteoporosis
        2. Ernest Kwek et al. - start slightly anterior and lateral and aim posterior and medial to overcome bow. However, need to be cognizant of varus malreduction as well as we do that. 
    5. Contralateral prophylactic nailing
    6. Treat underlying cause
        1. May need drug holiday, work closely with endocrinologist
- What position and approach?
    - Lateral vs Traction table
    - **Lateral advantages** ‚Äì counteracts iliopsoas flexion forces, brings GT closer to skin (good for obsess)
    - **Disadv** ‚Äì may need manual traction, presence of contralateral prosthesis may affect II
    - However, in my practice, i usually do on traction table.
- How will you reduce?
    - Reduction tools ‚Äì Schanz pin to proximal fragment, Cerclage wires, Large bone clamps, Poller screws, Finger tool, Ball spike pusher, femoral distraction, collinear clamp
- What implant will you use for subtrochanteric fracture?
    - Based on the **NICE guidelines,** I will use an intramedullary and not an extramedullary implant
    - [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg124/chapter/Recommendations#surgical-procedures](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg124/chapter/Recommendations#surgical-procedures)

- Any role for extramedullary devices for Subtrochanteric fracture?
    - There is literature pertaining to sliding extramedullary devices for subtrochanteric but patient selection is important - the medial cortex must be intact and non communited to allow the plate to act as a tension band
    - Ekstrom et al. in JOT 2006 found no major difference in functional outcomes, complications between nail and medoff sliding plate
        
        [Ekstrom Subtroch.pdf](Femur%20Fractures%20-%20Head%20Neck%20IT%20Shaft%20Distal%20ab000f8c1e3e4310ad7a4015a7f0623b/Ekstrom_Subtroch.pdf)
        
    - However, a study by Rahme et al. found higher revision rate 28% vs 0% when using fixed angle plates.

- How do you accomodate for abnormally bowed femurs in asians?
    - 2 ways - implant choice and technique
        - Implant choice
            - Use a nail of **smaller** radius of curvature = TFNA
                - Synthes TFNA has the smallest radius (more bowed) = Radius 1m
                - Synthes PFNA 1.5m
                - Zimmer Natural nail, CMN = 1.27m (24-34cm) - 1.4m (36-42cm)- 1.5m (44-48cm)
            - Use nail of **smaller** diameter
            - Use nail with **piriformis-start** nail (basically straighter nail) [Ernest Kwek Paper]
        - Techincally, based on Ernest Kwek's paper in 2019, my entry point will want to allow the nail to accomodate for the bow.
        - This can be done with a more **ANTERIOR and LATERAL** starting point to prevent anterior and lateral perforation

    - Varus (glutes pulling it) and Procuratum (iliopsoas pulling it)

### SCENARIO: AFF #‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

- What are AFF? How does Bisphosphonates cause AFF?
    - Evidence suggests that AFF are stress fractures.
    - There is generalized supression of bone **remodelling** due to bisphosphonates.
    - And because remodelling action localizes at areas developing stress fractures, thus affect adversely the intracortical repair of developing stress fractures
- What is the incidence of AFF?
    - Based on NEJM study of 196,000 women on bisphosphonates, 277 had fractures , 1.74 fractures per 10,000 patient-years
    - It is almost 6 times more likely in **asians** compared to whites
    - No association with weight
    - NEJM on AFF.pdf
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What is the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) criteria for AFF?
    - 5 major
        - **1**from LT to Supracon,
        - **2**minimal trauma,
        - **3**short oblique/ transverse #,****
        - **4**non comminuted,
        - **5**complete fracture
    - 7 minor
        - **1**Lateral periosteal reaction,

        - **6**use of meds (PPI, Steroids, BP),
        - **7**Comorbid condition (low Vit D)
- What is the incidence of contralateral AFF after one Fracture?
    - **20% contralatera**l # if you **stop** BP
    - If do not stop, 50% risk of contralateral fractures

    - 4 = Segmental with no contact
- What kind of traction will you use?
    - Thomas splint - a form of fixed traction

- Will you ream the femur in polytrauma?
    - Yes i will. If patient meets the criteria for EAC, and is suitable candidate for nail, Study by Bosse et al. **found that reaming does not increase occurence of ARDS, PE, MOF, pneumonia or death.**
        - Bosse et al. 1997 - Retrospective study - The use of intramedullary nailing with reaming for acute stabilization of fractures of the femur in multiply injured patients **who have a thoracic injury without a major comorbid disease** does not appear to increase the occurrence of ARDS, PE, multiorgan failure, pneumonia, or death.
        - COTS RCT 2006 - 322 femoral shafts fractures Randomized. No difference in incidence of ARDS in reaming femur in multiply injured patients
    - "I will use the criteria for EAC - pH > 7.25, BE < -5.5, Lactate < 4 to decide on definitive, work with ICU colleagues to determine stability, being aware of the advantages of reaming.
- When will you use retrograde nails?
    - Bilateral, Floating knee, Obese ++
- Does retrograde nail affect knee function?
    - Daglar et al. JOT 2009 RCT of 70 patients into antegrade vs retrograde. No difference in functional knee scores and isokinetic testing at 1 year
- Segmental femur shaft fractures - considerations?
    - Positioning - traction table
    - Adjusts - Femoral distractor
    - Entry point - usually displaced (flexed and abducted) as sub trochanteric element
    - Middle segment - **hold on during reaming to prevent devascularization if it spins!**
- Traction table with contralateral THR dangerous to flex hip - options?
    - Scissoring on traction table instead of flexing into leg holder
    - **Retrograde** nailing on supine
    - **Supine** antegrade nail
    - **Lateral** antegrade nail

    - **Length aim to be across LT** to avoid stress riser

## SCENARIO 2: AO 33C Fracture (Intra-articular)

- What approach for intra-articular comminuted fracture?
    - I will use a lateral approach to the femur with an anterolateral arthrotomy extension to access the joint
    - And if a medial plate is required (medial comminution), I will use a subvastus medial approach

## SCENARIO 3: CONVERSION TO TKR

- How will you one day convert to TKR? Considerations?
    - ‚ÄúThis is a complex primary EEE, RRR‚Äù
    - Pre op
        - Template - Consider staged procedure to prevent stress riser if pre op longest stem unable to bypass screw hole
        - Stand by stemmed implants, augments for bone stock
        - Assess incision - either use old one or to use the more lateral one.
    - Intraop
        - Exposure - KIV extensile
        - Explantation of the implant
        - Evaluate and replace bone stock
        - Re-implant TKR with stem to bypass screw holes with 2 cortical diameters
    - Rehab
        - FWBAT
- Incision management in presence of old incisions?
    - Principle is to have skin bridge 7cm, if not can connect scars with 60deg angle
    - In general use the most lateral one - because the blood supply to the anterior knee arises predominantly from the **medial** side from anastomoses of the femoral and popliteal arteries
    - Transverse incisions can be ignored
    - In situations where there are multiple incisions, Insall described the **delayed incision technique**
        - The skin incision is made, the skin flaps are elevated for the arthrotomy, and then the wound is closed regardless of the clinical appearance.
        - Assuming no skin necrosis has occurred, the knee arthroplasty is carried out through the same incision 4 to 6 weeks later.
        - It is thought that this technique not only tests the viability of the skin flap but also promotes increased collateral circulation secondary to the healing process.
