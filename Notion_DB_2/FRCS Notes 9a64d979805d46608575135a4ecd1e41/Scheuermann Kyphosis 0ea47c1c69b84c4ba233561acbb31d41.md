- ‼️ What is Scheuermann Kyphosis?
    - Defined as Rigid Thoracic kyphosis > 45 deg(cobb angle method), Anterior wedging of > 5 deg across 3 consecutive VB
    - idiopathic condition
- Types of scheuermann kyphosis?
    - Type 1 = thoracic spine only
    - Type 2 = both Thoracic and Lumbar spine
- What is the prognosis of Scheuermann?
    - < 75 deg – mild LBP rarely affecting ADL
    - 75 – 100 - severe LBP
    - > 100 – pulmonary function compromise
- Classical features on XR?
    - endplate irregularities
    - Schmorl’s nodes (herniation of disc into VB)

- Management principles for severe kyphosis?
    - Correct sagittal balance to < 5cm Sagittal Vertical Axis

- What are the 3 osteotomy options for Kyphosis? Any other considerations?
    - **10/30/40 °** correction

    - **Smith Petersen Osteotomy (SPO)** = hinge at disc
        - aka Ponte Osteotomy aka Posterior column osteotomy
        - Excision of posterior column with **hinge at disc** w disruption of disc
        - 10 deg/ segment
    - **Three Column Pedicle Subtraction Osteotomy (PSO)** = hinge at anterior VB
        - Excision of posterior cloumn and wedge of VB **hinge at VB**; No disruption of disc.
        - 30-40 deg/ segment
    - **Vertebral Column Resection (VCR)**
        - Remove of one VB with SPO done on adjacent levels
        - 45 deg/ segment
    - **Considerations**
        - Kinking of spinal cord - May need to lengthen anterior column with age
        - Nerve roots - consider sacrificing if required
