### SCREW

- ‼️ ⚠️ What is a screw?
    - Device that **converts torque** into an **axial force**
- ⚠️ What are the **components** of a screw?
    - Head with a RECESS for screw driver (most common now is star or hex due to higher resistance to stripping)
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Neck (Weakest section of the screw)
    - Core diameter = Diameter of the cylindrical shaft (size of drill bit)
        - Determines the stiffness of screw (This is the diameter of the drill)
    - Outer diameter (Name of screw refers to this)
    - Thread depth = Outer - core Diameter
    - **Pitch** = Distance **between the screw threads**
        - The finer the pitch, the higher the pullout strength
    - **Lead** of screw = **Distance travelled with each 360 degree turn**
    - Tip of the screw
        - Non-self tapping = conical tip
        - Self tapping = with cutting flutes
            
            ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%203.png)
            
        - Self-drilling + self tapping
- ⚠️ What is the relationship between pitch and lead?
    - In **single start** screws, pitch is the same as lead
    - However, if **double start** screws, **lead is 2 x the pitch** (and so on.... triple start lead is 3 x...)
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%204.png)
        
- Types of screws - differentiate cortical, cancellous, half threaded, locking screws
- Difference between cortical and cancellous screws?
    - Cortical screws have smaller pitch due to more dense cortex.
    - Cortical - Also has larger core to outer diameter (thread depth is smaller)
    - Cancellous - can be cannulated, can be partially threaded
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%205.png)
    
- ‼️ What is the usual failure mechanism between cortical and cancellous screws?
    - Cancellous bone
        - Pull out rate is higher due to low density
        - So to reduce pull out risk, thread depth is bigger with larger pitch
    - Cortical screw
        - Concern is breakage of screw due to hard bone!
        - So Core is bigger to overcome that to increase screw rigidity
- ‼️ Why does fatigue failure occur at the neck shaft junction?
    - It is an area where there is a change in cross sectional area, and thus, it is an area of stress concentration.
- Difference between self tapping and self drilling screws?
    - The presence of a drilling flute
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%206.png)
    
- Are self drilling screws meant to be uni or bicortical?
    - Unicortical.
- What are different uses of screws?
    - Lag screw, positional screw, locking plate screw, reduction screw, poller screw, interlocking screw,
- What is counter sink?
    - It can achieve a few things
        - 1. Increase surface areas at which the head is in contact of bone, reducing stress
        - 2. Allows the screw to be less prominently placed on the bone
- How to increase **pull out strength** of screw?
    - Design of **screw** - decreased core diameter, increased thread depth, decreased pitch, number of screws, use of locking plate
    - **Technique** of insertion - bicortical, No tapping, do not have repeated withdrawal and insertion
    - **Patient** factors - bone density, cortex diameer
- What are the lag screw principles?
    - Either by design of by technique
        - By design - partially threaded screws
        - By technique -
            - First drill the near side to the outer diameter to create a **gliding hole**
            - Through the gliding hole, drill the far cortex to inner cortex
            - Counter sink ➔ Measure ➔ Insert
- **What size drills for lag screws?**
    - Small fragment - **3.5mm** for gliding hole, **2.5mm** for far cortex
    - Large fragment - **4.5mm** gliding hole, **3.2mm** far cortex
    - Mini fragment - 2mm for gliding hole, 1.5mm for threaded hole
    - Tap size is SAME as screw size. So 3.5mm for small, 4.5mm for large
- Why do you use a washer? How do you use it?
    - Washers spread the load applied by the head to cortex by increasing the surface area of contact
    - Washer has 2 sides - **flat side and concave side**. Flat side is to be on the bone; concave side is on the screw head
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%207.png)
        
- What are reverse cutting screws?
    - Reverse cutting screws are used to make screw removal easier. Self tapping with reverse cutting flutes
    - Good for peadiatric cannulated screw in SCFE that require removal at a later date
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%208.png)
    
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the working length of the screw?
    - Depends on whether the screw is unicortical or bicortical
        - If unicortical - it is the length within the CORTEX. Highly dependant on the cortical thickness
        - If bicortical - it is the length traversing through
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%209.png)
        
- How do **interference screws** work?
    - Achieved by shaping the 2 mating parts so that there is slight deviation in size and not a line to line fit.
    - Interference refers to one part interfering with the space that the other is taking up, resulting in increased **friction** between the surfaces, leading to **stability**
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 11.40.24 AM.png](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_11.40.24_AM.png)
        
- What are **bioabsorbable screws**? Pros and cons?
    - Material can be Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly -L-lactic acid (PLLA) or Polyglycolic acid
        - Work by interference fit… with slight deviation in size…
        - Screw interference with the space that holds the graft and bone… increases friction… increases stability
    - **Pros** - does not interfere with MRI, decreased incidence of graft laceration (compared to metal), does not need removal, does not interfere with revision
    - **Cons** - screw failure during insertion, reaction to foreign body

### PLATES

- Types of Plate configuration?
    - Neutralisation
    - Compression
    - Bridging
    - Buttress
    - Tension Band - conversion of tensile force to compression forces on opposite side of fracture
        - Plate/wire must be on tension side
        - Compression site must have an intact cortex
- How to improve fixation in osteoporosis? How does it change?
    - Locking screws on plate = fixed angle device
    - Does not allow for sequential failure, but will need to fail as a unit
    - Bicortical
- ‼️ How does compression plating work?
    - Compression plates work by frictional force between bone and plate.
    - When a screw is tigtened against the plate, it generates a compressive force between plate and bone ➔ this leads to a reactionary friction force between bone and plate.
    - Failure depends on **shearing forces vs frictional forces.**
    - Increase frictional force by tightening screws ➔ but risk of localised necrosis ➔ so low contact plates
- How much compression is achieved when you use the compression plate?
    - About 1mm
- ‼️ How do you sequentially compress the plate?
    - Insert another screw eccentrically on the **initial positional screw side**
    - Just before it starts to compress, remove the initial positional screw, then screw it in
- ‼️ How do you put on a compression plate? [Draw]
    - Prebend the plate with **concave side on the bone**
    - Holding screw applied on the side without the axilla
    - Second screw placed in eccentric hole
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 4.49.45 PM.png](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_4.49.45_PM.png)
    
- How does locking plates differ from compression plates?
    - Does not rely on friction of plate and bone but as a fixed angle construct
    - Mechanism of failure different as it is a fixed angle contract and screws cannot pull out individually.
    - For locking plate to fail, there must be en-bloc pull out of the entire interlocing screw system
- Why do you need to prebend the plate?
    - If do not prebend, it can lead to gapping at the fracture site. This makes the plate a fulcrum and leads to increased stress at the plate holes.
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Slight pre-bending causes the ends of the opposite cortices to drive together.
- What is the working length of plates?
    - Between the 2 screws at the fracture site
    - It is inversely proportionate to the stiffness
    - So compression plate = aim for stiffer = short working length
    - If comminuted = need to be less stiff = longer working length
- Ideal plate density?
    - Gautier et al. on Plating principles
    - Plate length should be
        - **2-3 times** in comminuted fractures and
        - **8-10 in simple fractures** (to achieve suitable working length)
    - Plate screw density aim for **0.5-0.4 (less than Half of plate holes occupied)**  - for comminuted fractures
    - Achieve working length to be 1/3 of the plate length
- ‼️ Why is ideal plate length 8-10x for a comminuted fracture?
    - 2 reasons
    1. Achieve longer working length to allow more movement and secondary bone healing
    2. Because the plate becomes a load **bearing** construct, I want to apply the near near far far concept to reduce pull out forces on the screws
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 4.40.50 PM.png](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_4.40.50_PM.png)
        
- What kind of plate should you use for Humeral shaft, explain it with its structural property?
    - 4.5mm plates. (4.5mm refers to the height)
    - The bending and torsional rigidity is proportionate to its height to the power of 3. h^3
    - Furthermore, the 4.5mm has a staggered screw placement compared to 3.5mm plate thus conferring more stabiilty.
- How does a **tension band construct** work?
    - It works by converting **tensile forces into compression forces** by **shifting the center of rotation** to the tension band itself
    - Pre-requisite is that there must **not be comminution** at the compression side
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2011.png)
    

![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 4.39.29 PM.png](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_4.39.29_PM.png)

- Problems with a short working length in a bridge plating?
    1. Too much stability ➔ to little strain to induce secondary bone healing
    2. Plate is functioning as a load **bearing** device here. If short working length → Too much stress on a small surface area  ➔ risk of fatigue failure
- Can you describe the near-near- far-far principle?
    - Far Screw
        - Biomechanically, this screw is resisting **cantilever** forces about the fulcrum at the fracture end
        - The further it is, the lesser the force required to prevent pull out in view of higher moment arm from the fulcrum
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 7.02.48 PM.png](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_7.02.48_PM.png)
            
    - Near Screw
        - Biomechanically, this screw is resisting **second class lever forces** exerted by the plate end
        - The nearer the screw is to the fracture site, the larger the moment arm
            
            ![This diagram shows the benefit of a long plate](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_7.08.39_PM.png)
            
            This diagram shows the benefit of a long plate
            
    - For a comminuted fracture, you want to make sure you balance working length with near-near screw ➔ so do not place it too near
    - For compression plating, you can maximise near-near screw to also reduce working length.

### Dynamic Hip Screw

- ‼️ Explain screw cut out in DHS?
    - **Patient** - Poor bone density - screw is stiff, bone cuts into implant ➔ cut out
    - **Technique** - High TAD
        - Screw not in high density subchondral bone but in weak cancellous bone
        - Screw trajectory mismatch resulting in cold welding/ sliding restriction
    - **Implant** factors - Wrong choice of short barrell
        - If short barrell is used ➔ **shorter moment arm to resist varus torque,** forces on the screw on barrell leads to poor sliding ➔ cut out

### RIGIDITY

- Relative Young's Modulus of materials and tissues vs bone?
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2013.png)
    
- What are the type of deforming forces?
    - Bending, Torsional, Shear
- In an IM nail, what determines the rigidity?
    - **Material** properties - young's modulus
    - **Structural** properties - working length, diameter of rod
        - 1. Inversely proportionate to Working length of nail - the shorter the nail, the greater the rigidity (affected by reaming (reduces working length), fracture pattern, interlocking screw position)
        - 2. Diameter of the rod that influences SMA and PMA
- What determines the **bending rigidity**?
    - **Second Moment area**, which is proportionate to the radius to the power of 4 of the rod or height to the **power of 3** for the plate
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2014.png)
        
    - Second Moment Area and it is influenced by the radius or height of the object
        - Rectangle = height influences by **power of 3**
        - Cylinder = radius to power of 4
        - Hollow rod = outer radius (to power of 4) - inner radius (to power of 4)
- What determines the **torsional rigidity**?
    - Polar moment area which is also to the same proportional increase as SMA
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2015.png)
    

### NAILS

- ‼️ What is the working length of a nail?
    - Depends on torsional or bending stresses
    - **Torsional** working length - is always between the 2 screws
        - Isthmus fit does not give resistance to torsion
    - **Bending** working length - segment of nail unsupported by bone in a well fitted nail or between the proximal and distal screws in a loosely fitted nail.
        - isthmus fit provides some resistance to bending too.
- What does it mean that the nail is load sharing or load bearing?
    - Load sharing in simple transverse/ short oblique # (with cortical contact)
    - Load bearing if comminuted #

- What is the effect of reaming and blood supply? How long does it take to revascularize?
    - Usual blood supply is **centrifugal,** from in to out with inner 2/3 supplied by the nutrient artery.
    - Reaming disrupts this blood supply BUT, it is able to compensate  with periosteal blood supply immediately, such that cortical blood supply is maintained (Reichert 1995) ➔ Blood supply becomes outside in (centripetal)
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled.png)
    
    [reichert1995.pdf](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/reichert1995.pdf)
    
    - According to a fractured sheep tibia model, cortical **revascularization occurs by 6 weeks in unreamed but not until 12 weeks in the reamed group.**
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%201.png)
    
    [https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)
    
- What are the **benefits of reaming**?
    1. Autografting by debris from intramdullary healing
    2. Release of growth factors
    3. Expansion of canal to fit a larger sized nail that is stiffer
    4. Reaming **reduces** the working length which then increases torsional and bending rigidity. 
        1. Torsional and bending rigidity is inversely proportional to its working length
- Concerns of reaming and how do you circumvent?
    - Heat is generated in reaming with concern of thermal necrosis ➔ do not ream with tourniquet
    - Risk of fat embolism due to rise in tramedullary pressure during reaming possibly indeuced also by piston-like effect of intramedullary reamer ➔ forces bone marrow, fat and other contents into metaphyseal vascular systems
    - ➔ in intact femur prophylactic nailing, create ventilatory hole
- ‼️ Why hollow vs Solid rods?
    - For the same diameter, the hollow rod is significantly lighter but relatively minimal loss of bending and torsional rigidity and can also be used a guide for the wire
    - Assuming outer radius is 2 and inner radius is 1
    - **Calculating weight**
        - Weight = πr2H
        - 4πH vs 3πH (4πH - 1πH)
        - Weight **drops by 25% (1/4)**
    - **Bending and Torsional rigidity both power of 4**
        - SMA = **πR^4/4**
        - 4π vs 3.75π (4π - 0.25π)
        - Bending and torsional rigidity **drops by only 6% (0.25/4)**
    - Practically, can also be used as a guide for wire
- ‼️ Why hollow vs Solid rods? [Simple Answer]
    1. Hollow rods allow the use of ball tip wire as guide
    2. Hollow rods of same volume of material has a larger diameter and thus higher bending and torsional rigidity 
    3. More weight-efficient
- Why hollow vs Solid rods assuming same amount of material (Wang Ming
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2016.png)
    
- Why closed section nails vs open section (i.e. Slotted) nails?
    - There is very little difference in bending rigidity between both designs
    - However, **torsional** rigidity is much lesser in slotted nail. This is due to "circumfrential discontinuity"
    - Stress is transmitted uniformly through the entire thickness of a closed section nail without change in direction. But in open section, there is a change in direction
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2017.png)
        
- Circular vs cloverleaf shaped nail (Kuntscher nail)?
    - The clover leaf shape allows some stability by the expansive spring mechanism with elastic deformation of the implant
    - Usually the medually canal was prepared by reaming with the diameter of the nail slightly bigger than the diameter of the last reamer to allow for this.
        
        ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2018.png)
        
    - However, they do not have interlocking screws, so rotational stability is an issue.
- How can you describe nails?
    - Can be discussed by 5 main areas
    - **Materials** - SS vs titanium
    - **Insertion** points - GT, piriformis, Lateral entry
    - **Solid vs hollow**
    - **Closed vs open** section nails
    - **Biomechanics** - load sharing vs load bearing depending on fracture
- How do you reduce hoop stresses when inserting the IM nail? [Why are nails curved?]
    - 1. Use a curved nail that corresponds to bone curvature
        - A straight nail leads to excessive mismatch leading to excessive hoop stresses especially at the canal ➔ anterior cortical perforation
    - 2. Entry point must not be too anterior
        - If entry point is anterior to central axis, then a large insertional force is required for nail insertion ➔ high hoop stresses ➔ shaft fracture

### LOCKING BOLTS

- How are locking bolts different from other screws?
    - They have a wide core diameter and smaller outer thread diameter
    - They are not designed to maximize pull out strength but designed to resist 4 point loading
- What are the advantages of locking bolts?
    - They control torsion and axial loading, providing rotational and longitudinal stability
- What are potential disadvantages of locking bolts/ their holes?
    - The holes in the nail can act as stress risers as they become the weakest part of the nail to fatigue
    - There is an increased risk of nail breakage if the fracture is within 5cm of these screw holes AND if the screw hole closest to the fracture is left unfilled
    - Screw holes closer to the end of the nail allow fixation of more proximal or distal fractures but at the expense of the stability of the whole nail.
- What may occur if you place too many bolts in multiple planes?
    - IM nail allows healing with relative stability.
    - Screws in multiple planes increases stability and reduces micromotion and may lead to fracture healing
- How to reduce risk of locking screw fatigue?
    - Technique of insertion - ensure no notches
    - Use larger screws
- Why don't simply use the largest possible locking screw?
    - Increase diameter of a locking bolt **reduces the cross section of the nail at its hole, thus predisposing to nail failure**
    - Nail hole size **should not exceed 50%** of nail diameter
- ‼️ What are the forces on the locking bolt?
    - It undergoes 4 point bending loads
    - Thus under axial load and in the absence of cortical contact, bending of the screw and failure may occur
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2019.png)
    
- ‼️ Why do we need a large core diameter in the locking bolt vs nail?
    - The aim of the locking bolt is to resist 4 point loading forces
    - The design thus sacrifices pull out strength with ability to tolerate bending forces as determines by the Second Moment Area (larger core diameter, smaller thread depth)
    - Bending ridigity is to the power of 4 with the diameter

### K-WIRES

- What are the various designs of K-wires tips?
    
    ![Untitled](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%2020.png)
    
    - Trochar had 3 facets grount to a point
    - Diamond had 2 opoosing flat facets
    - Medin had 2 steep flutes
- How to reduce temperature and heat necrosis?
    - Design - Medin tip lowest temperature. followed by diamond and trochar. Trochar highest temperature (126 vs 98 vs 66 °) (JBJS paper)

    - Speed of drilling
- What is the olive tip used for?
    - Aid in reduction in circular frames
    - Increases overall construct stability

### EXTERNAL FIXATION

- What kind of Ex fix do you make?
    - Near-Near, Far Far pin arragement to provide maximum control of bone fragments and improve construct stiffness
    - Near pins reduces working length = reduces strain and motion; increasing stiffness
    - Far pins provides more stability due to its long moment arm
- What increases stability of the Ex fix?
    - **Pin** factors - diameter, number, stiffness of pins
    - **Rod** factors - number of bars
    - **Construct** factors - biplanar, more rows, nearer to bone
- ‼️ ⚠️ Principles of circular frame? What is an ideal "ring block"
    - Consists of rings, half rings, rods, wires.
    - An ideal “ring block” consists of **2 rings**, connected to each other by **4 rods** with at least **2 points of fixation to bone**
    - Fixation to bone can either be
        - OR 3-4 wires with 1 half pin
        - 1 tensioned wire with 2 HA coated half pins [i.e. 1 pin = 2 wires]
- ‼️ ⚠️ Wire principles for circular frame?
    - **60-90 degrees** between wires
    - Olive wires can help with reduction and also provide stability
    - Tension to about **90-130kg**. Must be done simultaneously
- How to increase stability for circular ex fix?
    - Tensioning of the wire
    - Reduced distance of the ring from the bone
    - Increased number of rings and connecting struts
    - HA pins can enhance stability
