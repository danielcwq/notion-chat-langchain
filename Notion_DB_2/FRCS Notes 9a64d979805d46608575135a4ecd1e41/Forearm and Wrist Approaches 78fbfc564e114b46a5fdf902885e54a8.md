### Henry's Approach to forearm

- **Plane**: Brachioradialis (mobile wad) // Pronator teres, FCR
- **Danger**: SRN, radial artery
- **I**: Biceps tendon to radial styloid
- **D**: Skin ➔ Subcut ➔ Identify BR muscles ➔ go medially and incise fascia ➔ dissect down ➔ ligate recurrent branches to the mobile ward (retract radial artery medially)
- **Deep** - plane depend on level
    - **Proximal third** = Incise **supinator** from most medial edge - do in full supination

    - **Middle third** = incise **pronator teres**; do in full **pronation**
    - **Distal third** = **FPL** and pronator quadratus

### Trans-FCR approach [Goes through FCR sheath but also then lateral to FCR]

### Modified henry’s approach [Goes lateral to FCR; mainly for distal radius]

- Modified Henry approach retracts radial artery radially (**laterally**)
- Modification is which side of the radial artery you go. Classic henry approach retracts radial artery medially

### Thompson Approach [Continues from the Kaplan approach]

- Danger: PIN piercing through the Supinator muscle in the deep disection
- Plane = ECRB//EDC; ECRB//APL distally
- I: Lateral epicondyle to Listers tubercle
- D - Skin ➔ Subcut ➔ Identify ECRB and EDC ➔ Go in between and this will expose the supinator proximally and the APL distally

- **Proximal third =** Kaplan Approach
- **Middle third** - bring arm into **full supination** to bring origin of supinator into view and PIN away from field

- **Distal third** - Undermine the **APL and EPB [first EC compartment]** and lift them up with a vessel loop
