“My goals of treatment are to have a stable, concentrically reduced hip to allow normal acetabular development to prevent degenerative joint disease. And my treatment is dependant on the age of the patient”

pavlik harness if a Flexion Abduction Orthoses, a dynamic splint which relies on the child kicking out to reduce to hip. used till 5 months. 3 pre-requisites - reducible, no contractures, no neuromuscular injury.

- What is DDH?
    - Spectrum of dysplasia from dysplasia to subluxable/ dislocatable to subluxed/ dislocated
    - 1 in 1000
- Where is the deficiency in DDH?
    - Deficiency is **anterolateral**
- What are the risk factors?
    - Risk Factors – **FFFFF** = Female, first born, foot first (breech), family hx, fluid - oligohydramnios
- ‼️ What are the other packing disorders? [Top to bottom]
    - Plagiocephaly
    - Congenital muscular torticollis
    - DDH
    - Posteromedial tibia bowing
    - Metatarsus Adductus
    - Calcaneovalgus foot
- What is teratologic hip?
    - **"tertalogic hip" is not DDH** ➔ aw Neuromuscular, arthrogryposis
    - It is a **dislocation of the hip at birth**. Dislocated utero and irreducible on neonatal exam

## SCENARIO 1 = < 6 months [Q = PAVILK]

![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled.png)

- How will you approach this patient?
    - Hx = FFFF, twins, tumor in uterus (fibroids), birth weight (big baby)
    - Oligohydroaminos - packaging disorder
- ‼️ What physical exam? What signs?
    - Asymmetrical Groin crease - More specific is **inguinal crease** not thigh crease
    - Galeazzi **Sign [Galeazzi is a sign]**
    - Start with **Ortolani** **test** to reduce with abduction [Do Ortalani first] - If positive, no need to do barlow anymore.
    - Barlow test to dislocate
        - Thumb on medial thigh, index on GT, adduct axial load
        - Force: Until blanching of skin on baby's knees (white knuckle sign)
    - Look for a/w packaging disorders (top to bottom)
    - Look for club foot
    - Check the SPINE - spina bifida and other spinal causes of DDH
- Till how old do barlow and ortolani test remain present?
    - By 3 months, they disappear due to soft tissue contractures about the hip
- When is US accurate?
    - only accurate **6-8 weeks**
    - If done at birth, will be inaccurate
- What are the angles on US?
    - Alpha angle = acetabulum to ilium axis [>60]
    - Beta = labrum to ilium axis [<55]
    
    ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%201.png)
    
- ‼️How do you classify this Ultrasound?
    - **Classifx** = Graf – **alpha** angle
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Class 1 **> 60**
    - Class 2 43 – 60
    - Class 3 **<43**
    - Class 4 = dislocated
- What lines do you look for on the XR? At what age do you do XR?
    - > 3 month = XR (epiphysis ossifies then); usually do at **6 months**
    - **Shenton** line
    - **Hilgreiner** line - intertriradiate line
    - **Perkin** line - lateral acetabular
    - **Acetabular index** = hilgreiner’s line and line drawn to the lateral edge of acetabulum (this is slightly different from Adult dysplastic hip AI of Sharp)
        - < **30** at 3/12, < **18** at 18/12
            
            ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%203.png)
            
    - Also ask – is femoral head there?
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%204.png)
        
- What is your **goal of treatment in patients** with DDH regardless of age?
    - Achieve a concentric, spherical, congruent and contained hip to prevent future degeneration
- What is a Pavlik harness?
    - It is a "dynamic flexion abdcution" orthosis which allows for motion within the range of stability.
- When will you institute the Pavlik harness?
    - Based on my instutition Protocol
    - If O and B are positive = Pavlik (must be clinically reducible)
    - If O and B are negative but are at risk infants FFFF ➔ US at 6-8/52
        - If Class 3 or class 4 = Pavlik
    
    ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%205.png)
    
- Is US **screening** for DDH a good screening test?
    - This kind of question go straight into What makes a successful screening test based on the WHO 1968 guidelines
    - **Disease (4)** DDH has significant consequence, natural history is known (becomes OA), pavlik harness is effective, if intervene early at birth can avoid complications.
    - **Screening test (3)** simple to do and no radiation thus accepted, Low costs, US has high sensitivity and specificity
    - **Population (2)** - prevalence is 1 in 1000 or as high as 34 in 1000, parents are willing to have children undergo treatmetn
    - What makes a successful screening test? - (DDH, Scoliosis)
        - There are **three groups of criteria**
        - Disease Criteria (4)
            - Disease must have significant **impact**
            - Natural **history** of disease is known
            - Detection can occur before a **critical point** before being too late
            - There must be accepted and **effective treatment** available
        - Screening test features (3)
            - Accepted and tolerated
            - **High sensitivity** - Low false negatives (can catch more - if there are low false negatives, then there has to be false positives)
            - **High specificity** reduces false positive
        - Population features
            - Disease must have high enough prevalance [Scoliosis 3%, DDH 1:1000]
            - Patients willing to undergo treatment
- What is the pre-requisite of a Pavilk harness? What are the **contraindications**?
    - Hip must be reducible
    - Must not have any major **muscle imbalance - arthrogryposis, myelomeningocele**
- ‼️ How do you apply the pavilk harness? Angles?
    - 4 straps to place hips in the Human position which is 100 ° flexion, 100 ° abduction
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Shoulder strap – not too tight to avoid Brachial plexus Injury
    - Chest strap
    - Anteromedial strap – flex hip to 100 deg
    - Posterior strap – to **limit adduction** to 50 degrees (4 finger breath between knees) [common misunderstanding to think that this is to abduct the hip when it is prevent adduction]
- ‼️ What are the complications of pavlik harness? GIve me 4.
    - **Brachial plexus injury** shoulder strap too tight
    - **Femoral nerve palsy** – due to excessive flexion
    - **AVN** – due to too much abduction – impingement of posteriosuperior retinacular branch of MFCA.
    - **Pavlik harness disease** – posterosuperior acetab erosion due to unreduced hip. can happen when patient does not adjust as patient grows ➔ femur gets longer and slowly dislocates again
- How long do you wear it for?
    - 23hour/ day, adjust splint 2 weekly
    - **US weekly** with harness on until reduction achieved (About 3 tries)
    - Once reduced ➔ **6 weekly US ➔** 2 weekly adjustments
    - Wean harness off after **at least 3 months** or **twice the age** at presentation whichever is longer
    - If unreduced ➔ check compliance ➔ closed reduction ➔ recheck 1/52 (no need check immediately)
- What is the age limit for Pavlik?
    - About 6 months - Child will overpower the harness
- When can we stop follow up?
    - If 2 years old, XR shows concentric reduction with good acetabular cover, can discharge patient
    - Nanni Allington et al. series of 109 hips shows, that if at 2 years normal, then at 10 years follow up, all no issues

---

- What if patient failed pavlik harness at 3 months or head irreducible?
    - I will **wait till 6 months** before planning for closed reduction in OT
    - This is for 2 reasons?
        - Balance GA risks
        - Secondary ossification nucelus developed 4-6 months, so that visible on II

## SCENARIO 2 = 6-18 months/ Failed Pavlik [Q = Closed or Open reduction]

- Patient failed pavilk how will you assess?
    - Hx = Check for compliance
    - PE = assess for teralogic features - neuromuscular conditions arthrogryposis
- ‼️ ⚠️  What is Ramsey Zone of Safety?
    - Rephrase” Essentially the **cone of motion that the hip spica allows the hip to move without dislocating”**
        - In the hip spica, some movement is possible about 15-20 degrees in both planes
        - Thus, need to place it in a position that is as wide as possible but yet within the dislocation range. “
    - It is the **range of motion in which the hip remains reduced** in comparison to the maximum range of motion. The wider the range the better
    - Because, the ROM of the hip in the hip spica is about 15 degrees, we need to keep the in a position in that
        - at least 15-20 away from the limit of dislocation in both AP and coronal planes
        - 20 degrees away from maximum abduction to prevent AVN
    - So, the safety zone is the ROM (cone of motion) is the zone within the 15-20 maximum range of motion and dislocation range.
    - Based on this, the hip dislocates in extension and adduction. which is what the pavlik harness prevents the hip to go into.

- What do you do after a closed reduction?
    - Place hip spica in **Human** position =100 deg flexion, abduction 50. (same as Pavlik harness position)
- When will you do adductor tenotomy? What are the risks of Adductor tenotomy?
    - Adductor **LONGUS** tenotomy increases Adduction safe zone, Psoas tenotomy increases extension safe zone
    - Adductor tenotomy will increase safe zone, allowing more abduction
    - Risk: **Obturator nerve anterior division**
- How to confirm reduction intra-op? Signs of unreduced hip on Arthrogram?
    
    ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - Figure 1 = reduced hip. Rose thorn sign is normal finding of contrast between capsule and labrum. FIgure 2 = showing **medial pooling.**
    - **Medial pooling > 5mm** instead of rose thorn sign
    - Rose Thorn Sign - contrast between capsule and labrum and the superior aspect (normal finding)
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%209.png)
        
- How to confirm post reduction?
    - Single cut CT scan
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- ‼️ What if close reduction fails? **What is blocking it?**
    - Blocks to reduction **2 + 5**
    - **Extra cap** = **psoas muscle, adductor longus (mention last)**
    - **Intracap** = pulvinar, ligamentum teres, Hypertrophic TAL, hourglass capsule, **inverted labrum (aka Limbus)**
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- How long do you keep in hip spica for?
    - Change after 6 weeks, ideally re-check CT single cut.
    - So total 6 + 6 = 12 weeks (3 months)
    - After 3 months, change to **Abduction orthosis e.g. Swash brace until ambulating**
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2012.png)
        
- Which structure can you NOT release in reduction?
    - Inverted Labrum
    - "The limbus can also resolve spontaneously in a reduced hip or can invert and cause obstruction to concentric reduction. There has been debate about its removal, although current reports argue that excision should be avoided."[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2504652/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2504652/)
- What do you do with ligamentum teres?
    - Usually we do not excise it to preserve blood supply. Usually it is not a major block.
    - Can debride it if it is too big.

## SCENARIO 3 = > 18 months [Q = Open reduction]

- What clinical signs?
    - Galeazzi test - Supine, flex the knee, heels to buttocks.
    - Asymmetrical groin crease
- ‼️ What approaches for open reduction?
    - Anterior vs medial approach
    - **Anterior approach** - allows access for pelvis osteotomy as well
    - **Medial approach** -
        - (+) advantage of reduced tissue dissection, minimal blood loss and cosmetically excellent scar.
        - (-)MFCA is in the surgical field - potential risks of disruption and AVN
    - Medial approach (**Ludloff Approach**) - interval between **AL// Gracillis then** **AB// Magnus/ pectineus** with hip flexed and abducted
        - Some studies suggest increased risk of AVN, however, Hoellwarth et al. in JPO 2015 in study of age matched cohorts, f/u 2 years, no difference in AVN rates.[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25270942/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25270942/)
        - [https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/full/10.1302/0301-620X.96B3.32616](https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/full/10.1302/0301-620X.96B3.32616)
- Which approach will you use for which age?
    - If < 1 year, I will use the medial approach
    - If > 1 year, use anterior approach to access for pelvic osteotomy
- Age limits for reduction-only and require osteotomy?
    - Reason is because remodelling will be more and more limited as child grows older
    - > 8 years for unilateral
    - > 5 years for bilateral

## SCENARIO 4 = **> 2 years** [Q = need osteotomies as **remodelling is now limited]**

- How do you do open reduction KIV osteotomy?
    - Approach = anterior smith- Peterson (TFL//sartorius) or Medial approach
    - Reduce first to station
    - If unable to ➔ **femoral shortening and derotation (externally rotated) and varus producing**[via separate lateral incision]  ➔ acetabular osteotomy ➔ cast in **Lorenz** position
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2013.png)
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2014.png)
        
    - Single cut CT scan to confirm reduction
- How much to shorten?
    - Distance is from base of head to base of acetabulum. Not more than 2.5cm
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2015.png)
        
- Does femoral shortening osteotomy increase AVN rates?
    - Theoretically, shortening reduces the pressure on femur head and hence should reduce AVN rates
    - But studies show no difference.
- What acetabular osteotomy will you do for this child?
    - **Salter** re-directional osteotomy = osteotomy of anterior and posterior column with hinge at pubic symphysis
    - If older, and triradiate has closed, Steels triple osteotomy which is a salter + pubis and ischial cuts.
    - [Paeds Hip/ Pelvic Osteotomies](Paeds%20Hip%20Pelvic%20Osteotomies%204afb04e7dc824c149ce4d284b151a893.md)
- What are the risks of open reduction? How do you address it?
    - **Sciatic nerve** injury due to tension ➔ Femoral shortening
    - **AVN** due to disruption of blood supply - do not dissect posteriorly
- What is Lorenz position?
    - Maximum **IR** and **abduction**
        
        ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2016.png)
        
    - Most contained most concentric position BUT iliopsoas must be released if not will strangulate head.
- What are the features of AVN after DDH?
    - **failure of appearance or growth of the ossific nucleus** 1 year after the reduction
    - **broadening** of the femoral neck
    - increased density and fragmentation of ossified femoral head
    - residual deformity of proximal femur after ossification

## SCENARIO 5 = > 8 yo [Q = Salvage osteotomies]

- How does a neglected DDH present?
    - Painless limp
    - Why painless? Dislocated hips will not lead to OA, it requires a false acetabulum to have OA, so no pain.
- What is the treatment principles for a neglected DDH after 8 yo?
    - No more acetabular remodelling after 8 ➔ so do PAO
- Classic XR Arjandas shows of bilateral neglected DDH?
    
    ![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2017.png)
    
    - Bilateral Neglected DDH
    - Management? Do not touch the patient
- XR of DDH post salter osteotomy. thats why iliac crest looks funny as thats where the graft was taken.

### SCENARIO 6 = Treated DDH

![Untitled](DDH%20c6eab8aafe9c47b8ba0e16550f66870c/Untitled%2019.png)

- How do you know if patient had previous pelvic osteotomies?
    - Obturator foramen are asymmetrical - some rotational surgery has been done
    - Missing iliac crest - used as bone graft
