### Fracture Related Infection

- How will you diagnose a FRI?
    - Based on **Metsemaker’s consensus paper 2017**
    - **Confirmatory criteria** – Sinus, fistula, pus
    - **Suggestive** – Clinical, radiological, new effusion, raised CRP ESR, wound drainage
- What investigations?
    - Bloods
    - Imaging - XR, CT Scan (to look for stability, confirm non union)
- What is the key difference from PJI?
    - Fixation device can be removed after healing occurred, so complete eradication of infection is not always primary goal
- What are the main considerations?

    - **Timing**! – presence of biofilm –
        - Early < 2 wk
        - Delayed 2-10 wk;
        - Late > 10 wk
    - **Stability**/ callus formation – KIV CT scan
    - **Skin** coverage
    - **Host** factors - immunocompromise? Can tolerate multiple ops?
    - **Bacteria** - if it is a virulent bacteria

- What is your management goal?
    - **Eradicate** infection whilst maintaining fracture **stability** to allow healing. Also be prepared for any **skin coverage** requirements
- How will you treat a ACUTE INFECTION < 2 week?
    - Debride and retention + Abx
- How will you treat a CHRONIC INFECTION > 2 WEEK?
    - “Formation of biofilm, necessitate staged surgery with re-stabilization”
    - Divide into **patient optimisation and surgery**
        - Medical
        - Control risk factors - DM, smoking, PVD
        - Honest discussion on limb salvage vs amputation
    - **First Debridement (3 +1)** = Eradicate infection, **BONE/ STABILITY/ SOFT TISSUE**
        - Adequate Debridement to paprika sign and healthy bleeding
        - Assess stability of implant KIV remove
        - Can consider shortening (may need fibula osteotomy)
        - Address **dead space** - cement beads/ threaded cement
        - **Temporary Ex fix** for stability, Temp negative pressure dressings
    - Subsequent ops
        - Repeated debridements clinically and biochemically
        - Until cultures are negative
    - **Definitive Surgery (3) = BONE/STABILITY/ SOFT TISSUE**
        - Address Bone loss
        - Address stabilization
            - Exchange nailing
            - Circular frame
            - Plating
        - Address Soft tissue = flap coverage
- How to treat stable implant but infected?
    - Confirm with XR/ CT to show callus and healing
    - Antibiotics suppression until bony union then remove implant
- How do you manage bone loss - Options, Pros and Cons?

### Bone Loss Management

- What is “critical bone defect”?
    - Defined as those that will not heal spontaneously within a patient’s life time without secondary intervention.
    - In terms of size - no definitive size.
    - Accepted to be greater than **1-2cm** with **greater than 50% loss of circumference**

### MASQUELET

- What is Masquelet Technique?
    - 2 stage technique
    - 1st stage
        - Radical debridement till paprika sign
        - Placement of PMMA Abx (vancomycin/ gentamicin) Spacer (Maintains space and prevents fibrous tissue growth into the defect)
        - Stabilize with **Ex Fix or Abx Coated IM Nail**
        - Achieve soft tissue coverage; flap if required
    - 2nd stage
        - 6-8 week time Gap
        - Excision of spacer
        - Placement of Autologous Bone graft (iliac crest/ RAI)
        - Stabilisation- pref Abx coated IM nail
- What is the time gap for?
    - Epithelialization of flap
    - Revascularization of tissue surrounding bony defect
    - Formation of self-induced periosteal membrane
    - Eradicate infection with Abx (Trend markers)

### Bone Transport Techniques - Monfocal (Acute shortening) Bifocal, Trifocal

- What is bifocal bone transport aka distraction osteogenesis aka Ilizarov technique?
    
    ![Untitled](Fracture%20Related%20Infection%20(FRI)%20Bone%20Loss%20Managem%20ae096b0b60e94141bfcdeb0ddcdc6e59/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - Thorough debridement
    - Exfix secured to the bone, a **corticotomy** is made away from the area of infection, **Leg is pulled out to length from start.**
    - **Latent** 2/52, **Distraction** 1mm/day, **Docking** 2 x distraction phase.
    - Docking phase - bone grafting may be necessary
- What is the difference between Ex Fix index vs Consolidation index?
    - **EFI** = duration of external fixation divided by the length gained.
    - **CI** = time of consolidation (from the operation day to the confirmation of consolidation) divided by the length gained.
- What is the commonly quoted Ex fix index for traditional lengthening with frame?
    - About **1.23 months per CM**
- How to reduce EFI and CI?
    - We can do lengthening over a nail

- What is acute shortening and lengthening AKA Compression-distraction method? (not bifocal)
    
    ![Untitled](Fracture%20Related%20Infection%20(FRI)%20Bone%20Loss%20Managem%20ae096b0b60e94141bfcdeb0ddcdc6e59/Untitled%204.png)
    
    - ASL - involves shortening first, and subsequent lengthening
- What is trifocal lengthening?
    - 2 osteotomy sites
- What are the pros and cons of each technique?
    - Masquelet
        - (+) no frequent adjustments - (no need high function patient)
        - (+) No docking site issues...
        - (-) Cannot correct deformiy
        - (-) Requires bone graft - donor side morbidity, need second op
        - (-) No early WB
    - Ilizarov Bone transport
        - (+) simultaneous **correction of deformity** and length
        - (+) Immediate stability and weight bearing
        - (+) Allows gradual **correction of deformity**
        - (-) Docking site issues - non union, scar interposition, refracture, translational deformity
        - (-) technically more challenging
    - Acute shortening Usually compare with Ilizarov bone transport tecnique
        - (+) No docking site issues
        - (+) immediate stability
        - No risks of non union as already compressed,
    - Strut graft - technically challenging, need microsurgical skills
- Size of gaps for which technique?
    - Acute shortening - < 3cm
    - Masquelet Up/ bone transport to 5cm
- Which will you choose?
    - I am aware of the masquelet techniques, bone transport techniques and Strut grafting technique
    - I will personally do the Masquet technique for its advantages of avoiding docking issues in bifocal strategies. I can also utilize a antibiotic coated nail as my choice of stability, preventing pin site infections in Ex fix, and no need for frequent patient adjustments
    - Bearing in mind the disadvantages of second stage surgery, donor side morbidity and inability to correct deformities.
- What type of bone formation is distraction osteogenesis?
    - **Intramemebranous** ossification

- What is this?
    - Identify the RIA - not a normal reamer
