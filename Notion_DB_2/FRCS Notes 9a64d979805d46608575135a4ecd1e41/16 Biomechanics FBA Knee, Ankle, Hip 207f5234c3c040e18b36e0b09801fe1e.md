- What are Newton's 3 laws?
    - 1st Law (**Inertia**) = Body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity in a straight line.
    - 2nd Law (**action**) = A body with a non-zero net force will accelerate in the direction of the force (F = ma)
    - 3rd Law (**reaction**) = For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
- What is moment?
    - Moment of force = Effect of a force at a **perpendicular** distance from the axis which results in rotational movement
    - Force = Mechanical Disturbance or Load that acts on a body
- What are the 3 kinds of Levers?
    - 1st class = fulcrum in between force and load e.g. Hip
    - 2nd class = Load in between fulcrum and force e.g. Ankle, 1st MTPJ
    - 3rd class = Force in between load and fulcrum = Elbow joint, shoulder joint (most inefficient)
- What are the assumptions in Free Body Diagram?
    - **Bone** - rigid, CG is at center
    - **Joint** - frictionless, assumed to be hinge, JRF is compressive
    - **Muscle** - only one direction in center of cross secional area of muscle mass, Only working in tension, no antagonists
    - **system -** in static equilibrium
- From top to bottom **FREE BODY DIAGRAMS**
    - 1. Shoulder Joint and effects of Reverse on JRF and load on JRF
    - 2. Elbow Joint and effect of weight on JRF
    - 3. Spine and lifting technique
    - 4. Hip and effects of stick, bag, medialization/ lateralization, trendelenberg
    - 5. Patella and effects of flexion on JRF, effects of patellectomy
    - 6. Ankle and effects of pes planus on JRF
    - 7. MTPJ and effects of pes planus on JRF

- **Shoulder FBA? [Equation method]**
    - Resolve all forces to Y-axis only, arm in 90 ° abduction

- Shoulder FBA + load and impact JRF?
    
    ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%201.png)
    
- Reverse Total Shoulder FBA? How does medialization of COR help in biomechanics efficiency? [Equation method]
    - Medialization increases the moment arm of deltoid. Increases efficiency of the Deltoid and also reduces JRF at the implant interface.
    - medialization by 2cm decreases JRF by half
        
        ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%202.png)
        
- **Elbow FBA?** Show how carrying a load increases JRF in Elbow. [Equation method] #draw
    - Elbow same as shoulder, just change deltoid to biceps
    - Resolve all in Y axis and calculate from there how weight in the hand increases JRF.

- Draw **FBA of Lumbar spine** to explain why one need to squats to carry things?
    - The nearer the weight is to the body, the shorter the moment arm of BW and the weight, the less compressive force across the disc

- **Draw Hip FBA**, with contralateral stick, ipsilateral bag? #draw
    
    ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - For ipsilateral bag, because it is on the other side of the fulcrum, we rotate the arrow, so the final diagram is same as the stick.
    - Assume weight is 5/6 BW, assume single leg stance
- Draw Hip FBA, explaining medialization surgery?
    - JRF decreases with medialization
        
        ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%209.png)
        
- Draw hip FBA, explain trenlenburg lurch?
    - Will be same as the contralateral stick or ipsilateral bag
    - Essentially, some of the weight goes to the other side of the fulcrum, so, in addition, the W reduces too.
        
        ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- ‼️ What happens if patient has AVN?
    - Assume collapse of femoral head ➔ reduced offset → leads to Glute insufficiency (requires force to stabilize pelvis due to shortened moment arm)
        - JRF increases significantly
- ‼️ If patient has L4/5 radiculopathy, which side should he hold his stick?
    - Weakness in glutes, So need to hold on opposite side to exert force in opposite direction
- How to reduce Joint Reaction Forces around hip?
    - Draw Hip FBA, based on this Free Body analysis, we can
        - 1. Reduce body weight ➔ loose weight, trendelenberg gait [W arrow shortens]
        - 2. Medialize Fulcrum ➔ medialization surgery [W reduces while additional W2 acts as a ipsilateral bag, also shorterned F arrow due to increased moment arm of abductors]
        - 3. Lateralize Abductors (make more efficient) ➔ laterilzation [F arrow shorter due to less force needed as moment arm increases]
        - 4. Ipsilateral bag or contralateral stick [additional of upward force]
- How many degrees of freedom does the hip have?
    - It is a ball and socket joint, so it has 3 DOF - flex/ extend; abduct/ adduct; Rotation
- How does walking affect JRF? SLR?
    - Normal walking 3 x
    - Fast walking 7 x
    - Straight leg raise 2 x

- **What is femoral roll back?**
    - Occurs at terminal flexion when femoral roll back allows greater flexion before impingement
        
        ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2011.png)
        
    - Contact points between femur and tibia moves back in parallel from 0 - 120° of flexion
    
    ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    - There is slight controversy. According to this paper, contact points shift backwards in parallel, but Roll back occurs only mainly over the lateral tibia plateau, i.e the femur rotates externally around a medial center
    
    [JBJS femur roll back.pdf](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/JBJS_femur_roll_back.pdf)
    
    - Adv - increases lever arm of quads, allows clearance
- What is the screw home mechanism?
    - Best described looking at the knee locked in standing position
    - Knee is locked when the **femur is internally rotated** over the tibia
    - Popliteus must contract to external rotate femur over tibia
        
        ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2013.png)
        
    - As the knee flexes, the lateral condyle rolls back more due to convexity
- What is the anatomical basis for the above 2 kinematics?
    - Tibia plateau is more convex on lateral ➔ So more translation on lateral side
    - Center of rotation is thus on the medial tibia plateau
    - Lateral femoral condyle also has larger difference in radii between posterior and distal condyles
- What are the kinematic models that the knee can be described with?
    - Four Bar linkage
        - Described as 2 cruciate ligaments and tibia and femur
            
            ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2014.png)
            
        - Flexion produces a mixture of rollback and sliding
        - Assumptions: ligaments are rigid
    - Degree of freedom model
        - Knee has 6 degrees of motion -
        - 3 rotations (VV, Axial, Flexion extension)
        - 3 **translations** (Superior/ inferior, medial/ lateral, A/P)
- How does ITB function?
    - It functions by its relation to the center of rotation of the knee joint
    - in extension, it is infront of the COR ➔ allows the knee to be locked in extension with less energy
        
        ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2015.png)
        
- Can you draw a FBA to show PFJ is highest in flexion?
    - 2 vectors made up of tension in Quads tendon and patellar tendon assumed to be equal magnitude in this simplified model that does not take into account for patella tilt
    - Drawing the resultant force, we can know the JRF which is equal and opposite to this force
    - if the knee is flexed further, parallegram will show that the resultant Force increases, same does JRF
    - The more the knee is flexed, the higher the resultant force, the higher the JRF.

- Draw FBA to show the importance of the Patella
    
    ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2018.png)
    
- What is the extent of contact between patella and trochlea?
    - Patella Biomechanics (Goodfellow 1976)
    - 0 ° no contact with femur
    - 20 ° start to contact femur
    - 20-90° Progressively more contact from lateral to medial until entire surface in contact at 90 °
    - 135 ° At full flexion, odd facet in contact with MFC

- What do you know biomechanics of the talus?
    - "Talus has **no muscle** attachments and acts as a **torque converter** between hindfoot and forefoot." [similar to lunate: [What is the role of the lunate?](https://workflowy.com/#/d0031e89ae8b)]
    - It is modelled as a mitred hinge – tibial rotation causes:
        - Subtalar joint inversion and forefoot supination
        - OR Subtalar joint eversion and forefoot pronation
- How does action of posterior tibial tendon helps in toe off?
    - Posterior tibial tendon acts in inversion of the transverse tarsal joint, locking it to become a stiff lever arm, allowing efficient toe off
    - **TN and CC joints** (transverse tarsal joint aka chopart joint)
    
    ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2019.png)
    
    ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2020.png)

    - When in **eversion** (at rest), axes of both joints are **parallel** and joint is relaxed
        - Foot is mobile and can adapt to uneven ground
    - When in **inversion** (by action of Post tib), axes **diverge** and joint is locked
        - Becomes a stiff lever arm for push off
- Subtalar Joint Biomechanics
    - Also described as a Archimedes Spiral Screw where rotational movements are converted to linear motion ➔ calcaneum moves forwards in inversion and backwards in eversion
        
        ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2022.png)
        
- How does the plantar fascia work?
    - It is a **Truss-like** structure spanning from the medial tuberosity of calcaneum to plantar aspect of proximal phalanges
    
    ![Untitled](16%20Biomechanics%20FBA%20Knee,%20Ankle,%20Hip%20207f5234c3c040e18b36e0b09801fe1e/Untitled%2023.png)
    
    - It's integrity is crucial in maintaining Joint Reaction Forces in the Ankle and the 1st MTPJ ➔ Draw Ankle FBA and effects of loss plantar fascia
    - It acts by a Windlass mechanism
        - As the metatarsophalangeal joints are extended passively when one pushes off, PF is shortened, shortening the distance from calcaneum to MT head
        - This makes the **base of the truss** shorter, and the arch height increased
        - This **locks the tarsal joint** to create a rigid lever for push off
- What are the biomechanics of toe push off?
    - In order for efficient push off, the foot must become a stiff lever arm
    - This is achieved by the action of the **posterior tibial tendon** and the **plantar fascia**
- Ankle FBA? What class of fulcrum? Describe the impact of Pes Planus OR failure of plantar fascia on ankle JRF
