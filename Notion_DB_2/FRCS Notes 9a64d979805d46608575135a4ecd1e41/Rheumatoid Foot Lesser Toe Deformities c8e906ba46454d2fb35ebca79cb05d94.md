### Lesser Toe Deformities

- What are claw toes associated with?
    - a/w Neurological conditions affecting balance of intrinsic

- Why do these neurologic Pes Cavus patients get claw toes?
    - Due to weakness of anterior tibialis tendon ➔ foot drop
    - **EHL and EDL** compensate to extend ankles
    - In order for toe pulp to contact ground ➔ FDL and FHL activates to plantarflex DIPJ
    - Chronically ➔ contracted soft tissue and MTPJ into extension ➔ and causes clawing
- How can you address claw toes?
    - **Joint Sparing Reconstruction** for flexible VS Joint sacrificing if fixed
    - **Options for reconstruction:**
        - **Girdlestone** procedure - transfer of FDL from base of distal phalanx to  dorsum of Proximal phalanx to reduce flexion force and reduce hyper extension of MTPJ **[For Claw and Hammer toes]**

        - **Jone's** procedure
            - To reverse claw toes. Orginally described for the hallux, but can also be done for the leseser toes
            - Tendon of EHL cut from its insertion and tied to the 1st MT neck via a medial approach (same as hallux valgus approach)
            - Fix DIPJ with K-wire which is removed after 6 weeks

            - Jone's procedure also for lesser toes
                - sugathan2009.pdf
        - **Weil** shortening osteotomies (of the MT), by shortening, it reduces the forces by the flexor tendons

    - **Joint Sacrificing**
        - DuVrie's Arthroplasty (excisional arthroplasty of PIPJ)
        - PIPJ Arthrodesis

- What causes hammer toes in hallux valgus?
    - Defunctioning of first ray ➔ **Transfer metatarslagia** ➔ Stress on 2nd MT ➔ Plantar plate rupture ➔ dorsiflexion of Proximal phalanx ➔ Hammer toe

- Management of hammer toes?
    - Flexible - **Girdlestone**; **Weil’s** osteotomy ; Fixed = **fusion**
        - **Girdlestone** procedure - transfer of FDL from base of distal phalanx to dorsum of Proximal phalanx to reduce flexion force and reduce hyper extension of MTPJ **[For Claw and Hammer toes]**
- What are mallet toes?
    - Isolated flexion of DIPJ
    - Contracture due to pressure of toe against shoe ➔ contracture of FDL, rupture of EDL
- Management of Mallet toes?
    - Flexible = Flexor tenotomy
    - Fixed = address joint by Fusion

### Bunionette

- ‼️ Classification of Bunionette?
    - Coughlins Classification
        
        ![Untitled](Rheumatoid%20Foot%20Lesser%20Toe%20Deformities%20c8e906ba46454d2fb35ebca79cb05d94/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - 1 = **Enlarged** MT head
    - 2 = Lateral **bow**
    - 3 = Increased **4/5MT Intermetatarsal angle > 8**
- Non op?
    - Non Op = shoe modification
- Op Management for bunionette?
    - Depends on the classifx
    - 1 = **Excision** of lateral prominence
    - 2 = Distal MT **osteotomy**
    - 3 = Oblique Mid-diaphyseal MT osteotomy
        - Avoid proximal osteotomy due to vascular watershed blood supply

### RA Foot

- Which joints in the foot affected more by RA?
    - Forefoot > Midfoot/ Hindfoot
- What is the pathophysiology of RA foot?
    - Synovitis ➔ joint capsule/ collateral ligament incompetence
    - Plantar fat pads becomes atrophic ➔ MT head displaced plantarwards ➔ Metatarsalgia + ulceration
    - Lesser toes deviate laterally ➔ hallux valgus
- Etiology of clawing in RA?
    - Due to progressive dorsiflexion of the toes during the gait cycle
    - Due to Plantar plate Synovitis, proximal phalanges subluxes dorsally
    - Leads to flexor- extensor imbalance (flexoin >> extensors) ➔ Flexible claw toe ➔ Rigid claw toe
- What is the management of RA foot?
    - Multidisciplinary, refer rheumatologoist, podiatry
- Surgical Management of forefoot RA?
    - Aim is to relocate and refunction the plantar plate again
    - Options
        - **Weils shortening osteotomy of MT** - to relocate the MTPJ

        - Excision arthroplasty
        - Synovectomy
- Surgical Management of hindfoot RA?
    - Preferentially address last after hip and knee
    - Temporizing treatment ➔ Synovectomy of Tibialis posterior and FHL
    - Can consider isolated talonavicular fusion in early RA
    - Definitive ➔ triple arthrodesis/ ankle arthrodesis.
- Which hindfoot joint commonly affected in RA?
    - The talo-navicular joint is most commonly affected, followed by the subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints.
