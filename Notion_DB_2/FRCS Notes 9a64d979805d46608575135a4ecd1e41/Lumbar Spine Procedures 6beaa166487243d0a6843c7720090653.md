- What are the landmarks for pedicle screw insertion?
    - **Cervical Spine** = **Magerl Technique** Lateral mass screws

        - Draw cross hair on lateral mass; **superomedial** quadrant
        - Direction - **20 deg divergent** , along facet joint
        - Alternative: Cervical spine lateral mass vs transpedicle screw
            
            ![Untitled](Lumbar%20Spine%20Procedures%206beaa166487243d0a6843c7720090653/Untitled%201.png)
            
    - **Thoracic spine** = lateral border of SAP and mid transverse process line (Same as lumbar spine)
    - **Lumbar screw** =
        - **Starting point** = **Lateral** border of SAP and mid transverse process line
            
            ![Untitled](Lumbar%20Spine%20Procedures%206beaa166487243d0a6843c7720090653/Untitled%202.png)
            
        - Direction = parallel to end plates
- Any difference in Cervical pedicle vs Lateral mass screw?
    - We balance safety with vertebral artery, using lateral mass from C1-C6. C7 can use pedicle screw
    - Pedicle screws sustain a significantly higher axial load to failure than lateral mass screws
    - [https://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/1997/05010/Cervical_Pedicle_Screws_Versus_Lateral_Mass.9.aspx#:~:text=The results of this study,the likelihood of hardware loosening](https://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/1997/05010/Cervical_Pedicle_Screws_Versus_Lateral_Mass.9.aspx#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,the%20likelihood%20of%20hardware%20loosening).
- What are the steps of pedicle screw insertion?
    - Identify entry point
    - Decorticate entry site with bur
    - Place **gearshift** probe into pedicle until resistance at anterior cortex - introduced with **concave facing outwards**, before rotating it to turn inwards

    - **Ball tip probe** (sound) to check floor, medial, inferior walls of pedicle
    - Tap  (if required)
    - Insert screws
    - Triggered EMG to test screws to ensure no pedicle wall breach
- Any special technique for thoracic spine?
    - “in-out-in” technique
    - In the thoracic spine, the “in-out-in” technique, where screws are intentionally placed more laterally to decrease the risk of medial breach and potentially increase bony rib purchase, is often also utilized.
    - The “in-out-in” technique can also be used in situations where patients have congenitally small thoracic pedicles.

- How do you assess pedicle screw position on XR?
    - Any Breach - medial, lateral, inferior, anterior
    - Lateral view - screws should pass midline
        
        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20Spine%20Procedures%206beaa166487243d0a6843c7720090653/Untitled%204.png)
        
        - BUT Not more than 2/3 from posterior because the vertebrae is round)
    - AP view - Screws should not pass midline
        - Screw should pass medial wall but not midline
        - Screws should not pass lateral wall
- ‼️ ⚠️ How do you prevent pedicle screw pull out in osteoporotic patient?
    - Screw Factors
        - Larger screw diameter
        - Cement augmentation
        - Expandable screws
        - Screw thread design - variable pitch (maximise purchase in pedicle), **dual thread** screws show greater pull our strength
    - Surgical technique
        - Trajectory - cortical bone trajectory which is **divergent and oblique** rather than convergent

        - Bicortical purchase
        - Avoid re-insertions
        - Load sharing with anterior column support
        - Supplementary fixation with laminar wires and hooks; **cross linking**
    - Patient factors
        - Optimise osteoporosis, start teriparatide 4-6 weeks before surgery and continue post op for 10 weeks
    - Biological augmentation
        - Bone Morphogenic Protein - BMP

- What is Bone Morphogenic protein?
    - It is an osteoinductive growth factors that stimulate bone growth
    - Commonly use BMP 2 and 7, currently mainly used in tibia fractures

- What are the complications of BMP?
    - Early complications
        - **Seroma** formation so keep the drain for longer period; avoid in cervical spine surgeries
        - Can cause **radiculitis** –inflammation around nerve roots. (Jacob Oh likes to mention retrograde ejaculation if irritate the hypogastric nerve in ALIF)
    - Late complications
        - Can cause **ectopic bone** formation ➔ cause compression
        - Can lead to **osteolysis**
        - Risk of **malignancy**, avoid in patients with risk of Ca
            - Contraindicated in patients in skeletal immature
- What are the various decompression procedures?
    - **Laminotomy** = Partial hemilaminectomy
        - Can be unilateral or bilateral
    - **Hemilaminectomy** = removal of one side lamina
    - **Laminectomy** = removal of entire lamina and spinous process
- What is the limit that one can remove facet joints without incurring instability?
    - 50%
- Complications of pedicle screw and Interbody fusion?
    - **Screws** - nerve root injury (ensure do under II, Neuromonitoring), injury to large vessels
    - **Interbody** cage - displacement, cage subsidence, cage back out, nerve root injury
- What are the normal dimensions of the lumbar pedicle screws?
    - 6.5/ 7mm screws
    - Length about 45mm
- What is the material for the interbody cages? Which one better?
    - PEEK = PolyEtherEtherKetone
    - Titanium cages also available.
    - Meta-analysis shows that both similar rate of fusion but increased rate of subsidence with titanium cage

- Does local antibiotics in spine surgery really reduce infection?
    - Controversial and evidence is based on retrospective studies with low levels of evidence; do not allow to draw clear conclusion
    - However, in my instution, we regularly put vancomycin powder

- What is the consideration for previous cementoplasy for TLIF?
    - Need to **drill** cement and **tap** cement prior to screw insertion
- Indications for cement in spinal surgery?
    - Screw augmentation
    - Vertebroplasties
    - Void fillers in spinal mets

### Fixation Technique Buzzwords

- How are you going to fix this burst fracture?
    - “I will use 3 column fixation with the 4th generation technique of pedicle screws to achieve a stable spine”
- What are the 4 generations of spine fiation?
    - 1st - harrington rods
    - 2nd - sublaminar wires
    - 3rd - segmental hooks
    - 4th - monoaxial and polyaxial pedical screws

### Dural Leak

- ‼️ How do you manage dural leak?
    - Ask for help
    - Principle is to expose to ensure adequate visualization
    - **Optimize visualisation**
        - Head down to reduce CSF pressure
        - Anesthesia to reduce BP
        - Remove more lamina to improve visualization
    - **Repair options**
        - Direct suture repair with 6/0 ethilon
        - Sealant glue
        - Augmented closure with fat, muscle tissue of fascial graft (if hole not opposable)
    - **Post op**
        - RIB, head up
        - Drain is controversial, can increase infection. Consider if big leak, and need to monitor leak post op.
        - Warn patient about headache
        - monitor wound as CSF has lytic enzymes which may lead to poor wound healing
- How do you diagnose dural leak in drain?
    - Clinically - headache
    - Drain findings - High persistent clear output, Glucose stick
    - Double halo sign on filter paper
    - Special tests - **beta-2 transferrin** assay
