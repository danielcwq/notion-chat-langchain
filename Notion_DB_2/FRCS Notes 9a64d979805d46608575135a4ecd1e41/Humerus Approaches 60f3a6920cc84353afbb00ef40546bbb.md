## Humeral Shaft Approaches

- **Anterior Approach** = Brachialis splitting approach [Workhorse]
    - Plane – Lateral Brachialis by radial nerve, medial by MCN.
    - Dangers – Radial nerve going anterior thru intermuscular septum 7cm above LE and now between BR and Brachialis muscle
    - I – lateral to biceps muscle
    - D – Skin, subcut ➔ Identify biceps muscle, retract medially to expose brachialis ➔ split brachialis in midline
- **Anterolateral Approach** (no splitting of brachialis) to distal humerus
    - Plane = Lateral half of Brachialis // Brachioradialis (both radial enrve)
    - P = hand table
    - I = Lateral border of biceps
    - D = Skin, subcut ➔ identify biceps; retract medially ➔ identify plane **between B and BR** ➔ FIND radial nerve 7cm above LE piercing through intermuscular septum ➔ perosteal elevation of brachialis medially
    - E - proximally extend between brachialis and Triceps muscle; distally extend into anterior approach of elbow between **BR and PT ➔ Henry's approach**
- **Posterior** = Triceps Splitting Approach
    - Plane – between lateral head (lateral spiral groove)// long head (**infraglenoid tubercle** of scapula)
    - S - lateral position
    - I – Midline
    - D – Skin ➔ subcut ➔ identify proximal bifurcation of long and lateral triceps ➔ Identify radial nerve w profunda brachii (protect with vessel loop) ➔ periosteal elevation of medial head

## Distal Humerus Approaches

- Positioning
    - Prone or Lateral decubitus position with arm on a radioluscent stand
    - Pre op check II assess, ensure patient is at the edge of the table
    - Sterile tourniquet
- Initial approach for all
    - Midline incision, full thickness flaps
    - Identify and dissect ulnar nerve, place a vessel loop around it
- A. Olecranon Osteotomy
    - Identify bare area of sigmoid notch 2-3**cm** from tip

    - If screw, pre tap and drill
    - "**Apex Distal** Chevron osteotomy" - saw but complete with osteotomy
    - Options for fixation – screw, TBW, plate
- B. Paratricipital aka Alonso-Llames aka Triceps-on
    - Develop surgical windows over both sides of the triceps muscle as it is elevated off the posterior border of the intermuscular septum and the posterior humerus
    - (+) Olecranon not osteotomized (no risk of non union/ hardware issues), triceps not disrupted (early ROM)
- C. Triceps Splitting
- D. Bryan Morrey aka Triceps reflecting Approach
    - Triceps insertion elevated superiosteally with a sliver of bone
- E. TRAP = triceps reflecting + anconeus pedicle
