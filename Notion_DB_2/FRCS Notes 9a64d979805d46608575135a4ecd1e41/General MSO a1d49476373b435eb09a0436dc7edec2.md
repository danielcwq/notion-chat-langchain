## Intro

- What are sarcomas?
    - Group of malignant tumors that arises from mesenchymal/ mesoderm/ connective tissue.
    - As opposed to carcinomas which are from epithelial tissues
- **Describing XR**
    - **1. Location**
        - Longitudinal
        - Transverse – Eccentric? Central?
    - **2. Action: What is tumor doing?**
        - Lytic/ Expansile/ Sclerotic
    - **3. Response: What is bone doing?**
        - Bone to lesion **Zone of transition** – wide or narrow

- ‼️ Which periosteal reaction is fastest?
    - [FASTEST] **Sunburst** reaction = ossification of Sharpey’s fibers!
    - Onion skinning
    - [SLOWEST] Codman triangle = Periosteum lifted up, has time for periosteum to lay down subperiosteal bone

        - **3 = Aggressive** – GCT, ABC, Chondroblastoma, Osteoblastoma (aggressive variant), Chondromyxoid Fibroma (CMF),
    - Malignant = MSTS System (MusculoSkeletal Tumor Society)
        - 1 = Low Grade

## MALIGNANT TUMOR MX

- Principles of investigation?
    - **Bloods** – FBC, CRP, ESR, **ALP** (Osteoblastic activity), **LDH** (osteoclastic activity), Calcium and phosphate, Renal panel
    - **Local Staging**
        - MRI with contrast whole bone - 5 things?
        - “Avid Contrast enhancement”
    - **Systemic staging -** Chest XR, CT chest, Bone Scan, PET-CT
    - **Biopsy**
- What are you looking for on MRI?
    - skip lesions
    - Joint involvement
    - NV involvement
    - Reactive zone (plan biopsy)
    - Paeds growth plate
- What sequences do you look for on MRI?
    
    ![Untitled](General%20MSO%20a1d49476373b435eb09a0436dc7edec2/Untitled%204.png)
    
- What are the types of biopsies?
    - Percutaneous vs Open
    - Risk of contamination in open is higher
    - Better yield in open (but improving over time)
    - Percutaneous **needle biopsies** - Core vs FNA – histology vs cytology
    - **CT guided** – can avoid necrotic area, avoid danger structures
- When do you need a biopsy?
    - Known cancer, but no known mets, presenting with a pathological fracture/ bone lesion
    - No known cancer with pathological fracture/ bone lesion
- ‼️ How will you biopsy this tumor?
    - There is no consensus on the optimal biopsy method for tumors - CT guided percutaneous Core biopsy vs Open Incisional biopsy
    - In my institution, we routinely use open incisional biopsy and this is what i will do - divided in to 3 parts…
- ‼️ **Principles of Open Biopsy?**
    - Open Biopsy - can be excisional or incisional (usually incisional)
    - **How to Biopsy?**
    - **Pre- Op:**
        1. MDT with primary MSO Surgeon, Med Onco, Rad Onco
        2. Ensure all scans completed
    - **Intra-Op:**
        1. No exanguination of limb but ok with tourniquet
        2. Extensile incision, thru one compartment (intramuscular plane, not intermuscular ),
        3. Avoid NV, 
        4. Good Hemostasis, 
        5. No [abx](http://abx.no/)
    - **Biopsy:** take sufficient samples, do not take from central necrotic tissue OR reactive zone but plan the biopsy from preop MRI to get live cells,
    - **Culture** all tumors, bone biopsy with circular corer/ drill to prevent stresss riser (as opposed to square with edges) and frozen section before closure
        
        ![Untitled](General%20MSO%20a1d49476373b435eb09a0436dc7edec2/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - **Post- Op:**
        - leave drain for 2/52 to avoid hematoma formation
        - Close in layers, Drain inline with incision, temporary stabilization
- Where should we biopsy?
    - **“Active areas” that are not cystic/ necrotic/ ossified.**
        
        ![Untitled](General%20MSO%20a1d49476373b435eb09a0436dc7edec2/Untitled%206.png)
        
- ‼️ Any evidence between the 2 biopsy methods?
    - *“Aware than Recent studies like*
        - ***Pohlig et al.** found similar accuracy for bony tumors but better accuracy for soft tissue tumors though not significant.*
        - **Aware** that **Irene et al.  2017** found that higher biopsy tract seeding rates in open biopsy 32% vs 0.85
        - *However, recent **JAAOS core exhibit paper by Traina et al.** reccomend for **imaging guided Core biopsy** in view of lower complication and lower costs. But for incisional biopsy if it returns to be non diagnostic”*
    - Pohlig et al. found
        - Similar accuracy for **bony** tumors
        - Better accuracy for open biopsy for **soft tissue** sarcoma
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 3.53.09 PM.png](General%20MSO%20a1d49476373b435eb09a0436dc7edec2/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_3.53.09_PM.png)
        
    - Recent AAOS Exhibit Selection paper by Traina in 2015 concluded that no consensus however, recommended that in view of low risk of contamination and low cost, **core needle biopsy appears to be more suitable** than open biopsy in the diagnosis of tumors
        - Image guidance is reccomended via US or CT scan
        - Recommend that if Core biopsy is non diagnostic, incisional biopsy can be performed.
    - Irene Ruiz - Irene et al.  2017 found that higher biopsy tract seeding rates in open biopsy 32% vs 0.85

- **Management Principles** of Malignant Tumor? - 4 phases
    - 1. Neoadjuvant Chemo or Radio
    - 2. Surgery
        - “Resection” - extended curretage/ wide excision/ intralesional/ **wide**/ **radical**
        - “Reconstruction or Amputation”
    - 3. Adjuvant Chemo or Radio
    - 4. Surveillance
- What are excisional principles?
    - Intralesional
    - Marginal – within pseudocapsule/ reactive zone
    - Wide = + cuff of normal tissue; outside reactive zone
    - Radical
        
        ![Untitled](General%20MSO%20a1d49476373b435eb09a0436dc7edec2/Untitled%207.png)
        
- What is the pseudocapsule? What is the significance?
    - Tumors grow in centrifugal fashion (inside to out), leads to compression and subsequent atrophy of surrounding tissue ➔ pseudocapsule
    - Outside pseudocapsule is the reactive zone.
- How do you decide amputation?
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 3.34.20 PM.png](General%20MSO%20a1d49476373b435eb09a0436dc7edec2/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_3.34.20_PM.png)
    
    - “Can I resect with clear margins and still have a useful limb?”
        - Joint/ extensive muscle or soft tissue involvement
        - NV involvement
        - Pathological fracture with hematoma violating compartment boundary
        - Severe infection
        - Immature skeletal age with significant LLD > 8cm
- What are the options of reconstruction in limb salvage?
    - Anatomical vs Non Anatomical recon
    - **Anatomical** – Endoprosthesis, Allo-prosthesis, megaprosthesis
    - **Non anatomical** – Rotationoplasty (ankle becomes the knee)

## RADIO AND CHEMOTHERAPY

- What is the mechanism of radiotherapy?
    - 2 mechanisms - indirect and direct
        - **Indirect** - Radiation produces free radicals in tumor and adjacent cells causing DNA damage and apoptosis
        - **Direct** - direct ionization of atoms in the DNA chain
- What types of Radiotherapy are you aware?
    - **cEBRT** (Conventional External beam radiation therapy) - delievers radiation
    - **IGRT** (Image guided radiation therapy) or stereotactic Body Radio therapy (**SBRT**)
        - Able to deliver **high doses** of radiation in close proximity to the spinal cord while maintaining radiation exposure of spinal cord and other adjacent vital structures within limits of safety.
    - **Brachytherapy** - radiation source inside or next to area requiring treatemnt - e.g. for rectum and cervix
- ‼️ What is the dose and course?
    - 1 rad = 1centi Gray = 0.01 Gray
    - Typical dose is **2 gray/day** (200cGy/day )
    - Total dose to treat bone tumors:
        - Osteosarcoma - median dose is **55.8 Gy**
        - So e.g. this works out to about 30 sessions of 2gray / day But this is done over 6 weeks
        - This allows normal tissue to recover from radiation damage
    - Dose-response tissue healing (TOTAL for whole course) i.e. radiotherapy is cumulative
        - < 45 Gray = uncomplicated tissue healing
        - 45 - 55 Gray = tissue heals but w problems
        - More than 60 Gray = Tissue likely will not heal
- ‼️ Complications of radiation?
    - Soft tissue
        - Early - delayed wound healing • infection
        - Late - fibrosis • joint stiffness
    - Post-radiation Sarcoma ~10%!
    - Post-Radiation fractures
- ‼️ What common chemotherapy?
    - DCMI port
    - Doxorubicin (antitumor antibiotics that attach to DNA)
    - Cisplatin (Alkylating agent that damages DNA)
    - Methotextrate (Antimetabolite folate analog)
    - Ifosamide
