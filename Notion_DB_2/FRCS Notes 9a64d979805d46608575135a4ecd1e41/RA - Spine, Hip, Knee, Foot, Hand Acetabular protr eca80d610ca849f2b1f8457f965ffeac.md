### General RA Questions

- ⚠️ What is the sequence of joint surgery in RA?
    - Forefoot deformity first - to allow comfortable weight bearing for rehab
    - Hip next - this will include referred pain at knee, address FFD in hip that impedes knee extension after TKR
    - Knee next
    - Hindfoot correction last - becasuse correction of hip and knee deformities may alter dynamic position of hindfoot

- ‼️ RA Preop Op consideration
    - **Anaethesia** review - Cervical instability, kiv “awake fibreoptic intubation“ kiv regional
    - **Medication** titrations -
        - *Methotextrate* - continue as no impact on wound healing
        - *Non biological DMARDS*e.g. Azathioprine - continue
        - *Biologics* e.g. TNF alpha inhibitor - stop 2-4 weeks before as they affect wound healing
        - *Steroids* - may need stress dose
    - **Intraop** for RA - osteopenia (intra op fractures) ➔ stand by contraint implants/ supplemental fixation, cemented implants
    - **Post op** for RA - wound care paramount - higher risk of infection
    
- What blood tests do you do for Rheumatoid Arthritis?
    - Based on the 2010 ACR criteria - blood tests are the following 4
        - Rhuematoid factor (positive in 75%)
        - Anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) - most sensitive and specific test)
        - CRP
        - ESR
- ⚠️ How to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis?
    - Based on the 2010 ACR (American college of rheumatology ACR)
    - 4 domains, total score > 6 to diagnose RA
    - Joint involvement, Serology of RF and Anti-CCP, CRP, ESR, Duration of symptoms

### RA Spine

- What are the 3 key features of RA C-spine? How you check?
    - AA-instability [ADI and PADI], Basilar invagination [Clark station, Cervical medullary angle], Subaxial subluxation [CHI]
- Pathophysiology?
    - Synovial pannus formation with erosions at facet joints ➔ instability

- ‼️ What are the best **predictors of Cervical Instability** that will reccomend fusion?
    - PADI < 14 = can quote Boden 1993
    - Boden 1993 = all patients who had class 3 ranawat RA cervical myelopathy had PADI of < 14mm. No correlation with ADI
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8408150/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8408150/)
    - Large Joint Index
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20721723/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20721723/)
- ‼️ How do you classify Cervical myelopathy in RA?

        ![Untitled](RA%20-%20Spine,%20Hip,%20Knee,%20Foot,%20Hand%20Acetabular%20protr%20eca80d610ca849f2b1f8457f965ffeac/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - **PADI** – posterior surface of odontoid to anterior aspect of C1 laminia (aka Space Available Cord SAC)
        - < 14mm = increased risk of neurological injury
    - **Atlanto-Dens Interval (ADI)** [**<3mm** in adults, <5mm in paeds]
        - 3-5mm = injury to TAL but intact Apical and Alar
        - > 5mm = all 3 disrupted
- Management is dependant on? How will you manage? What surgical options?
    - Non op if PADI > 14mm
    - Op
        - Indications – PADI < 14mm OR ADI > 9-10mm
    - Surgical options
        - Magerl transarticular screws (no loss of ROM)
        - Goel-Harms C1/2 Posterior fusion with lateral mass screws

    - **McRae’s line** - line from basion to opisthion. If dens crosses it = basilar invagination
    
    ![Untitled](RA%20-%20Spine,%20Hip,%20Knee,%20Foot,%20Hand%20Acetabular%20protr%20eca80d610ca849f2b1f8457f965ffeac/Untitled%206.png)
    
- What is cervicomedullary angle?
    - It is an independant risk factor of RA patients to develop myelopathy
    - NOT A BONY ANGLE
    - Angle between the line parallel to the ventral side of the medulla oblongata and the line parallel to the ventral side of the upper cervical cord on MRI of the cervical spine
        
        ![Untitled](RA%20-%20Spine,%20Hip,%20Knee,%20Foot,%20Hand%20Acetabular%20protr%20eca80d610ca849f2b1f8457f965ffeac/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - < 135 ° higher risk of developing myelopathy = indication for surgery
- What is surgical management?
    - Occipito-C2 fusion

### Subaxial Subluxation

- ⚠️ How do you assess for subluxation?
    - Lateral XR
    - Calculate Cervical height Index
    - **2 lines between 3 points:**
        - 1. Mid point of dens C2
        - 2. Mid point of C7 inferior end plate
        - 3. tip of C2 spinous process

    - This is a Complex primary
    - Considerations are - medications, osteopenia, acetabular protrusio, higher risk of dislocation
    - Pre Op
        - Stand by implants - **cemented** hybrid, consider dual mobility if there are also underlying neuromuscular disease
        - Templating, LLD correction
    - Intra Op
        - Exposure - extensile, Psoas and glute max release, insitu neck cut
        - Address protrusio
        - Femur prep - gentle rasping
    - Post op - standard post op

---

- What is protrusio?
    - Determine by drawing the Kohler's line (ischioischial line)
    - Defined by **femoral head** crossing or touching the ilioischial line.
        
        ![Untitled](RA%20-%20Spine,%20Hip,%20Knee,%20Foot,%20Hand%20Acetabular%20protr%20eca80d610ca849f2b1f8457f965ffeac/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - Medial wall > 3mm medial to ilioischial line in male or > 6mm in female

    - Grade 1 5-10mm
    - Grade 2 10-15mm
    - Grade 3 >15mm
- What are the THR considerations for patients with Protrusio?
    - Complex Primary, help of senior surgeon
    - Goal - restore hip center (associated with early loosening if not achieved)
    - Pre op
        - Templating
        - Stand by **equipment** -
            - **antiprotrusio** cages [meant to be used without pelvic discontinuity]
            - Triflange cages in the event of pelvic discontinuity
        - Stand by **allograft** (in case autograft not enough)
    - Intraop
        - Approach - posterior KIV Extensile exposure (glute max/ psoas release)
            - if for standard cup - May require adductor tenotomy, glute max release, may need insitu neck cut
            - If for cage - May require trans-trochanteric approach to gain exposure to the ilium to insert the iliac flange
        - Address protrusio defect by various means
            - Standard hemispherical cup with bone grafting medially
            - Augments
            - Cage
        - Plan for hybrid fixation - familiarity and good outcomes
    - Post op
        - Perhaps PWB for a while
- ‼️ How do you manage the protrusio defect?
    - Depends on the medial wall bone stock
    - **1. Standard Hemispherical cup**
        - Use reamer to **widen but not deepen** the cup
        - Insert morsellised graft (can be from femoral head) into prepared acetabulum, impact graft [impaction bone grafting]
        - Insert **cementless** cup
        - Can use revision hemispherical cup with multiple holes so to insert screws into ischium, pubic and ilium
            
            ![Untitled](RA%20-%20Spine,%20Hip,%20Knee,%20Foot,%20Hand%20Acetabular%20protr%20eca80d610ca849f2b1f8457f965ffeac/Untitled%2010.png)
            
    - **2. Antiprotrusio cages**
        - Apply plate and fix with screws
        - Cement liner into the cage
            
            ![Untitled](RA%20-%20Spine,%20Hip,%20Knee,%20Foot,%20Hand%20Acetabular%20protr%20eca80d610ca849f2b1f8457f965ffeac/Untitled%2011.png)
            
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is a key determinant of loosening in Protrusio?
    - **Restoration of hip center** within 10mm of the anatomical center
    - [Bayley et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3430153/) Journal of Arthroplasty follow up of 93 THR found that
        - **50%** loosening is hip center not within 10mm of anatomical center.
        - **8%** loosening if hip center restored to within 10mm of anatomical center

### RA Foot

- Which joints in the foot affected more by RA?
    - Forefoot > Midfoot/ Hindfoot
- What is the pathophysiology of RA foot?
    - Synovitis ➔ joint capsule/ collateral ligament incompetence
    - Plantar fat pads becomes atrophic ➔ MT head displaced plantarwards ➔ Metatarsalgia + ulceration
    - Lesser toes deviate laterally ➔ hallux valgus
- Etiology of clawing in RA?
    - Due to progressive dorsiflexion of the toes during the gait cycle
    - Due to Plantar plate Synovitis, proximal phalanges subluxes dorsally
    - Leads to flexor- extensor imbalance (flexoin >> extensors) ➔ Flexible claw toe ➔ Rigid claw toe
- What is the management of RA foot?
    - Multidisciplinary, refer rheumatologoist, podiatry
- Surgical Management of forefoot RA?
    - Aim is to relocate and refunction the plantar plate again
    - Options

    - The talo-navicular joint is most commonly affected, followed by the subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints.

### Rheumatoid Hand (‼️)

- How to describe RA Hand?
    - **Wrist** - caput ulna, **RADIAL** deviation
    - **Fingers** - boutonniere, swan neck, **ULNA** deviation
    - **Thumb** - Z shape (Boutonierres), gamekeeper, swan neck

    ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - "Bilateral symmetrical involvement"
    - Erosions in MCP and PIPJ
    - "periarticular osteopenia, Uniform joint space loss, bone erosions, soft tissue swelling, joint subluxation, subchondral cysts”
    - Radial deviation of wrist, ulnar deviation of fingers at MCPJ
- In RA Hands, which joints to do first? Arms or legs first?
    - Principles will be big joint Lower limb replacement first
    - This is to allow the use of walking aids without disrupting the UL recon
- If multiple joints involved in hands which will you do first?
    - Proximal to distal
    - Address caput ulna to prevent future tendon ruptures
- ‼️ How does RA causes all these hand deformities?
    - This question is going specific into each hand deformity
    - Deposition of Immune complex → panus → synovitis → joints and tendon ruptures
        - [Ulnar Deviation] Disruption of RC ligaments → radial deviation of wrist → changes tendon pull on the digits ➔ ulnar deviation
        - [Swan neck] Synovitis at MCPJ volar ➔ **Volar** subluxations of MCPJ ➔ extensors overpowered ➔ PIPJ Volar plate attenuation ➔ hyperextension of PIPJ
        - [Boutonierre] Synovitis at central slip ➔ rupture of central slip at base of P2 ➔ Lateral slips sublux volarly
- What is Caput Ulna Deformity?
    - it is the **volar subluxation of the carpus** resulting in the prominent ulna head
- Management of Caput Ulna?
    - 2 options of Bony procedures:
    - **Resection** of distal ulna - Darrach's
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - **Arthrodesis** of DRUJ with proximal pseudoarthrosis- Suave Kapanji technique
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Caput Ulnar.pdf
- Ulna resection vs DRUJ Fusion?
    - **Resection Darrach's** (+) Easy; (-) Progression of ulna translation of carpus with further sliding
- What is Vaughan-jackson syndrome?
    - Disruption of digital extensor tendons, beginning on the ulnar side with the EDM ➔ sequential rupturing of EDC ➔ EIP
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- What is Mannerfelt syndrome?
    - Rupture of the FPL tendon caused by bony spur in carpal tunnel
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2012.png)

- What is the management of mannerfelt syndrome?
    - Dependant on chronicity - if acute with fresh tendon edges - consider **bridge graft** e.g. Palmaris longus or FCR
    - if chronic and require **tendon transfer** ➔ FDS tendon
- How to approach "dropped Fingers"?
    - Can be due to PIN palsy or tendon rupture or sagittal band rupture (in RA - due to volar subluxation of MCPJ also) . Do 2 tests -
    - Check **tenodesis** test ➔ if positive = nerve problem or Sagittal band rupture
    - Check if fingers can **maintain extension** ➔ if positive = sagittal band rupture
    - Check for volar subluxation of MCPJ ➔ should be stiff and joints not reducible
- How do you manage dropped fingers due to tendon attrition?
    - Address primary pathophysiology of attrition. Darrach procedure to remove ulnar head (cause of ruptures)
    - Options:
        - 1. **EIP** to motor both EDM and ring finger
        - 2. EIP to motor EDM, long finger EDC side to side to EDC ring finger
        - 3. If insufficient tendons - PL and FDS tendons

### Boutonnieres (#❗️❗️ )

- What is Boutonniere deformity?
    - Rupture of central slip that attaches to base of P2 resulting in flexion of PIPJ and Hyperextension of DIPJ
- Causes?
    - Inflammatory - RA, psoriatric arthropathy
    - Traumatic - rupture of central slip
- ‼️ Pathophysiology of boutonnieres?
    
    ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    - 1. Central slip rupture due to trauma or inflammation (RA) ➔
    - 2. Attenuation of **dorsal** triangular ligaments holding the 2 lateral bands
    - 3. Lateral bands migrate volar ➔ causing PIPJ flexion and DIPJ extension
    - 4. Contracture of **volar** **transverse** retinacular ligaments and lumbricals on radial band ➔ fixed contracture
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2015.png)
        
- Clinical tests for **Boutonnieres**?
    - Elson’s test (acute) – extend PIPJ against resistance; check DIPJ
        - If loose, this means extension is by central slip
        - If stiff, this means central slip ruptured, compensated by lateral bands that attach to DIPJ
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2016.png)
        
    - Boyes test (chronic) – **Passively hyperextend PIPJ and assess DIPJ movement** [Like Elson's test if DIPJ is rigid, then positive test]
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2017.png)
        
        - If DIPJ is **rigidly extended and unable to be flexed**, this means central slip retracted with adjacent soft tissue contractures ➔ so the retracted central slip keeps pulling on the lateral bands to keep DIPJ extended.
    
    [Central slip rupture.pdf](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Central_slip_rupture.pdf)
    
- Classification of Boutonnieres?
    - Nalebuff - principle is fixed vs flexed
    - 1 = 15 deg extensor lag
    - 2 = 30-40 lag
    - 3 = **fixed** contracture with OA changes
- **Management** of Chronic Boutonniere? Special Splint?
    - 1 (Flexible) = **Capner** splint that keeps PIPJ extended
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2018.png)
        
    - 2 (Flexible)
        - Tenotomy of lateral bands and central tendon
        - Lateral band relocation and **Triangular ligament reconstruction**
        - Tendon reconstruction e.g. **Matev** procedure, FDS Slip transfer
    - 3 (Rigid) = PIPJ Arthrodesis (Presence of OA changes)
- What is the matev procedure?
    - One lateral band divided and sutured to remaining central slip
    - THe other lateral band crossed and suruted to opposite lateral band
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2019.png)
        
    - 
- How do you do FDS Slip transfer?
    - The FDS tendon is transferred from volar to dorsal through the lumbrical canal and sutured into the dorsally mobilized lateral bands
    
    [FDS transfer to lateral bands.pdf](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/FDS_transfer_to_lateral_bands.pdf)

- **Management** of Acute Central Slip rupture?
    - Non op = capner splint
    - Op if acutely displaced avulsion fracture, open wounds
- What is pseudo-boutonierre deformity?
    - 4 diagnostic features of this lesion (McCue et al. 1970)[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0072-968X_75_90013-3?journalCode=jhsa](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0072-968X_75_90013-3?journalCode=jhsa)
    - It is a flexion contracture of the PIPJ
    - Slight hyperextension of the DIPJ
    - Radiological evidence of calcification at proximal attachment of volar plate of PIPJ
    - History of hyperextension injury at PIPJ
    - Also used to describe the Duputryen's disease flexion deformity at the PIPJ
        - "Prolonged flexion contracture of the PIP joint can lead to central slip attenuation, incompetence of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint volar plate, and volar subluxation of the lateral bands"

    - Hyperextension at PIPJ, flexion at DIPJ

- ‼️ Pathophysiology of swan neck?
    
    ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - **Primary Lesion:** Volar plate laxity at PIPJ ➔ hyperextension of PIPJ by central slip ➔ **FDP** pulls DIPJ flexed ➔ Attenuation of the transverse retinacular ligament on volar side ➔ **Lateral bands** sublux dorsally and worsen hyperextension
    - **Secondary Lesion** leads to imbalance of forces on PIPJ with PIPJ extension forces greater than PIPJ forces
        - [MCPJ] **volar** subluxation in RA due to synovitis
        - [PIPJ] **FDS** rupture ➔ unopposed PIPJ extension with subsequent attenuation of transverse retinacular ligaments
        - [DIPJ] **Mallet** injury ➔ due to attrition of terminal tendon, extension forces now go thru central slip that attaches to base of middle phalanx, **leading to hyperextension at PIPJ**
- What are the causes?
    - Inflammatory - RA, psoriatric arthropathy
    - Traumatic - mallet finger
- Classification of swan neck deformity?
    - Nalebuff [essential principle is fixed vs flexible]
    - 1 = FROM, no intrinsic tightness
    - intrinsic tightness
    - 3 = cannot be corrected
    - 4 = Severe OA

- Clinical test for Swan Neck/ intrinsic plus deformity?
    - Bunnell test - to assess for joint stiffness
- What is the Bunnell's test?
    
    
    <aside>
    💡 What are the 3 special hand tests?
    
    **Bunnell**/ Swan neck/ intrinsic tightness /Passive/ flex MCPJ/ check PIPJ ROM
    **If better** = positive = intrinsic tightness
    **If not** = negative = capsular tightness; will not benefit from balancing procedures
    
    **Boyes**/ Boutonierre/ Passive/ Extend PIPJ/ check DIPJ ROM
    If better = flexible = can do balancing procedures
    If not = capsular tightness 
    
    **Bouvier/** Claw/ Passive/ Flex MCPJ/ See if claw straightens out
    if straightens = Zancolli capsulodesis
    if not but flexible = need Zancolli lasso
    if rigid and fixed = joint tightness
    
    </aside>
    
    - Bunnell´s test is a **passive** test, that evaluates the presence of intrinsic muscle tightness by comparing the range of motion and force needed to passively flex the proximal interphalangeal joints while the MCP joints are passively extended and flexed. It also helps determine if tightness is secondary to extrinsic muscle contracture or interphalangeal capsule adhesions.
    - If MCPJ flexed and PIPJ cannot flex better = due to capsule adhesions and soft tissue procedures will not work.
    - If MCPJ flexed and PIPJ can flex better = intrinsic tightness with no capsule adhesions
