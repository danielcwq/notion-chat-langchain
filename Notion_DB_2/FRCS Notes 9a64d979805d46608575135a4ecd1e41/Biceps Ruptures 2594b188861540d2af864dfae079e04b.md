### Proximal biceps Rupture

- What are the attachments of the biceps muscle

    - Long head - Supraglenoid tubercle
    - Short head - Coracoid
    - Both then attach to biceps tuberosity on the radius with the short head more distal to long head

- Innervation of biceps muscle?
    - Musculocutaneous Nerve
- Tenotomy vs Tenodesis?
    - No consensus on optimal treatment regardless of age group
    - Young **< 50 yo** No difference in functional outcome and strength
        - Jamie Friedman OJSM 2015, 42 patients f/u 3 years.
        - 35% popeye vs 18%
        - Flexion and supination strength same
        - No difference in outcomes scores
    - Elderly **> 50 yo** - No difference in functional outcome and strength
        - Koh et al. AJSM 2015
        - Popeye deformity 24% vs 9%
        - No difference in flexion strength, outcomes scores
    - Latest Meta-analysis of level 1 RCT. Belk et al. JSES
        - 5 RCTs. No difference in functional outcome scorews
        - More popeye deformity in tenotomy (23.3% vs 6.8%)
        - More biceps cramping at 6 months for tenodesis vs tenotomy

### Distal Biceps Rupture

- What clinical finding?
    - **Hook test (**false negative in partial tear, intact lacertus fibrosis)
    - **Reverse popeye**
    - Weakness is mainly in supination (40%); less so in flexion and grip.
- How will you treat this patient?
    - **Patient** factors - age, function, sport that uses supination e.g. racquet sports, swimming
    - **Injury** factors - understand natural history that only supination will be lost
- Outcomes of non operative management for distal biceps rupture?
    - **Supination power will be affected.** Flexion less so (due to brachialis being the primary flexor)
    - Freeman et al JBJS 2009 Non op - **Supination 63%** of contralateral, **flexion 93%** of contralateral compared with 92% and 95% with historical control. Median age 50 yo. Satisfactory outcomes on DASH scores and mayo elbow performance index.
    - 1985 Brucemaker - **86% loss of supination** with difficulty using screw driver
- What are the 2 common approaches?
    - Single incision
        - Longitudinal incision at the radial tuberosity, essentially a proximal henry's approach between BR// Pronator teres.
            - Watch for **LABCN**
            - BR // Pronator Teres (henry’s)
            - Supinate to expose tuberosity and to protect PIN
            - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262245/#:~:text=In%20a%20single%2Dincision%20exposure,exposure%20to%20the%20radial%20tuberosity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262245/#:~:text=In%20a%20single%2Dincision%20exposure,exposure%20to%20the%20radial%20tuberosity).
    - Dual (Anderson-Byod incision)
        - Transverse incision at flexor crease ➔ retrieve tendon
        - Posterolateral incision between ECU// EDC (note kocher is aconeus//ecu; Kaplan is EDC//ECRB
- Which approach will you use?
    - No significant difference in outcomes in literature
    - **Castioni et al. systematic review 2020** found no significant difference in outcome scores
        - Single - better ROM and lower risk of HO and reoperation. BUT theoretically higher risk of LABCN and PIN injury due to more dissection anteriorly
        - **Double incision** - lower risk of neurologic complications 24% vs 13% for LABCN only. - **Median, PIN, SRN no difference.**
    - “Thus in my practice, I will use single incision taking care to protect the LABCN and PIN nerves”
- How will you fix the tendon?
    - Options: Transosseous tunnel, Interference screw, Endobutton (suspensory device), Suture Anchors
    - If single incision -
        - suture anchor,
        - can use suspensory device with the help of a tip aimer to drill tunnel; but will require another small incision to insert endobutton

    - **Chavan et al. Systematic review AJSM 2008** - Endobutton biomechanically has the highest load and stiffness
