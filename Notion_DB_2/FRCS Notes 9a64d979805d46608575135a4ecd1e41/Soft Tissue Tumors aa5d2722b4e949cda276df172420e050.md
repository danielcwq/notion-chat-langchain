## Benign Soft Tissue Tumors

### Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS) (‼️)

- What is PVNS? Other name?
    - Benign, mono-articular proliferation of synovial tissue either in joint or in tendon sheath.
    - Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumors
- Common locations?
    - Anterior knee is the most common site of involvement (80%)
    - knee > hip > ankle > shoulder > elbow
        
        ![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled.png)
        
- Why is it brown in colour?
    
    ![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - Hemosederin
- What do patients present with?
    - Intra-articular: recurrent haemathrosis, pain, locking
- ‼️ Spectrum of presentation?
    - Intra-articular (Knee 80% > Hip > Shoulder > Ankle).
        - **Nodular/ localised**
            
            ![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%202.png)
            
        - **Diffuse = with extra-articular extension**
            
            ![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%203.png)
            
    - Extra-articular (tendon sheath) = GCT of tendon sheath
- Invx? What feature on MRI?
    - XR cannot differentiate PVNS and SC as no calcifications
        - Calcificiations = synovial osteochondromatosis
    - MRI - subchondral erosions
        - Both **T1 and T2 hypointense due to Iron deposition**
- What is the histology of PVNS?
    - Hemosederin stained **multinucleated giant cells**
- Any common differential diagnosis?
    - **Synovial chondromatosis** - (no ossification too)
    - **Lipoma Aborescens** - lipoma like benign villous proliferation of synovium
- Can we treat this conservatively?
    - Not recommended as it can erode into the bone in the long term and lead to early OA
- Management of LOCALISED type?
    - Local, Nodular – arthroscopic excision
- Management of DIFFUSE type?
    - Diffuse – Open synovectomy or arthroscopic
    - Open - can be combination of anterior and posterior approaches
- What is recurrence rates in Diffuse type?
    - 30%
- ‼️ How to reduce recurrence?
    - **External Beam Radiotherapy** 30 gray can reduce to 10-20% (less popular now)
    - Intra-articular **radioisotope yttrim -90** injection
        - Inject radioisotope 6/52 after surgery to prevent leak
        - Not recommended in Ankle due to skin necrosis

![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%2014.png)

- How common is melanoma?
    - Most common malignant tumor of the FOOT
    - 3rd most common skin tumor of the hand after SCC and BCC
- What are the prognostic factors of melanoma?
    - Depth - most important
    - Others - males, lesion on neck or scalp, mets, ulceration
- ‼️ What clinical features of melanoma?
    - ABCDEE
    - Asymmetry
    - Border irregularity
    - Color variation
    - **Diameter** (<6mm benign)
    - Elevation
    - Enlargement

    ![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%2015.png)
    
- ‼️ Management of melanoma?
    - Need to be treated **aggressively**
    - Depending on depth:
        - If < 1mm thick ➔ local resection with 1cm margin
        - If 1-2mm thick ➔ Local resection + sentinel node biopsy
            - If node biopsy positive ➔ Chemotherapy
    - Subungal melanoma ➔ distal amputation

### Synovial Sarcoma

![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%2016.png)

- **Most common** soft tissue sarcoma
- ‼️ What are the genes involvements in synovial sarcoma?
    - Translocation (X;18)
    - Gene mutation **SYT-SSX1, SSX2** gene (Sweet young thing)
- Mx = wide resection and radiation (variable response to Chemo)

### Epitheloid Sarcoma

![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%2017.png)

- Most common soft tissue sarcoma in **hand and wrist**
- Chemoresistant
- Mx = wide surgical resection and radiation; amputation

### Atypical Lipomatous Tumor/ Liposarcoma

- Terminology - Atypical Lipomatous Tumor vs Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma?
    - Use of the terminology ALT and WDL is based on a tumor's location in the body and primarily relates to resectability
        - Tumors are morphologically and genetically identical, with the variation in terminology intended to avoid both undertreatment and overtreatment
    - Tumors located in the **periphery** have **no risk of metastasis**
        - For such lesions complete resection is generally curative
        - For these tumors the designation as sarcoma is inappropriate and the term **"ALT"** is preferred
    - If the tumor is **deep seated** (retroperitoneum, mediastinum, spermatic cord), the chance of achieving negative margins is significantly diminished and the risk of local recurrence, dedifferentiation (DDL) and death are increased
        - Lesions are best regarded as true sarcomas and the terminology of "well differentiated liposarcoma" is more appropriate
- ‼️ How to differentiate suspected ALT from Lipoma on MRI?
    
    ![Untitled](Soft%20Tissue%20Tumors%20aa5d2722b4e949cda276df172420e050/Untitled%2018.png)
    
    - MRI compared to normal lipoma - 4 features
        - **Thick septa** > 2mm,
        - Size **> 13cm**,
        - Contrast update **> 1/3,**
        - **Heterogenous** with areas of necrosis
        - **Calcifications**
- ⚠️ ‼️ What is the histology test?
    - MDM 2+ (Murine Double Minutes 2 gene amplication)
- Management of an ALT?
    - Peripheral ALT = Marginal resection then frozen section TRO liposarcoma (remember bringing the lump to the histo lab while Mark closing)
        - If benign or low grade ➔ close, send for histo MDM2 gene amplification to confirm
        - If frozen or final histo comes back intermediate or high grade (i.e. liposarcoma) ➔ Wide surgical resection with radiotherapy
    - If final histo = ALT ➔ inform higher risk of recurrence compared to normal lipoma , follow up with future CXR
    - If final histo = liposarcoma → repeat wide resection with radiotherapy
