Studies: Revised x 1
Topic: Basic Science

- ‼️ What is the difference between sterilization, disinfection and cleaning?
    - **Cleaning** = physical process that removes contamination but not necessarily micro-organisms
    - **Disinfection** = process that eliminates micro-organisms EXCEPT bacterial **spores** or viruses e.g. Chlorhexidine, iodine, alcohol
    - **Sterilization** = destroys ALL microbial life
- ‼️ What forms of sterilization does OT do?
    - **Heat** - Autoclave (steam sterilization) - 121 ° at 15 PSI over 30minutes
    - **Radiation** - gamma radiation
    - **Chemical** - ethylene oxide, glutaraldehyde for heat sensitive equipments e.g. scopes
- What are the steps of instrument sterilization in the OT?
    - Decontaminate/ cleansing - wash with water/ detergent
    - Packaging
    - Sterilization - high or low temp
    - Storage
- How do you monitor for autoclave?
    - "Bowie Dick Tape"
    - Color-changing indicator of tape is usually [lead carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_carbonate) based, which decomposes to [lead(II) oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_oxide).
- How do we monitor sterilization processes?
    - **Mechanical** indicators - time, pressure, temperature
    - **Chemical** indicators - heat or chemical sensitive ink stickers (autoclave tape)
    - **Biological** indicators - putting commercially preparation of bacterial spores through the process and see if they die.
- ‼️ What do you know about the Lidwell landmark study? What are the factors of reduction?
    - MRC (medical research council) prospective RCT by Lidwell et al. **1982** found that vertical flow more effective than horizontal flow in joint replacements. Miulticenter study of 8052 joint replacement
        
        ![Untitled](29%20Inside%20the%20OT%2067522bce3ee2428ab535145581e0a841/Untitled.png)
        
    - Other factors are abx loaded cement, systemic antibiotics, ultra clean air, plastic isolators and body exhaust suits

## TOURNIQUET (#❌ )

- How do you size a tourniquet?
    - **Length** = 1.5 x the circumference so that to overlap 3-6 inches (too much overlap leads to to much pressure)
    - **Width** = "as large as possible but not touching the surgical site"
- What pressure? What equation?
    - Principle is = **Use lowest possible cuff pressure for as short duration as possible**
    - No absolute pressure but I will be mindful of the patient age, skin condition and underlying PVD
    - Usually it is **50mmHg higher** than systemic pressure UL and **twice the SBP** for LL.
    - More accurate method would be to calculate limb occlusion pressure which is 67 + circumference of limb/ 0.06 x width of tourniquet
        - Based on this equation, the larger your limb **circumference**, the higher the pressure, the larger the **width** of tourniquet, the smaller your pressure can be
            
            ![Untitled](29%20Inside%20the%20OT%2067522bce3ee2428ab535145581e0a841/Untitled%201.png)
            
- Contraindications for tourniquet?
    - Severe crush injuries, Sickle cell, PVD
- How do you exsanguinate the limb?
    - By **Elevation** or **Expression**.
    - Avoid expression (e.g. Esmarch) in infection or cancer.
- What should you do about the tourniquet if you are performing a long operation?
    - Release after 2 hours for LL, 1.5 hours for UL
    - Deflate for at least 20min
    - After that it can remain inflated for up to 60 minutes.
- ‼️ What complications with tourniquets?
    - Skin pressure sores, swelling, compartment syndrome from reperfusion, DVT
    - **Post tourniquet Syndrome** - due to **ischemia** and reactive hyper-perfusion resulting in edema, stiffness and pallor, **weakness without paralysis**
    - **Tourniquet Paralysis Syndrome** - flaccid motor paralysis with sensory disturbance due to compression of **nerves**. Patients with DM, peripheral neuropathy may have increased susceptibility.

## SUTURES (#❌ )

- What sutures do you use?
    - Absorbable
        - Synthetic - Vicryl (polygactin), monocryl, PDS (polydioxanone)
        - Natural - collagen, gut
    - Non Absorbable
        - Synthetic - Nylon (ethilon), Prolene
        - Natural - silk
- What is the effect of braided sutures? Disadvantages?
    - Increases friction coefficient and hence ability to fix knots when compared to monofilament
    - However, increased risk of promoting infection, also tissue trauma due to higher friction.
- Estimated resorption time?
    - Monocryl - wound support 20 days, resorb 3 months
    - Vicryl - Wound support 30 days, resorb 2 months
    - PDS - wound support 60 days, resorb 6 months

## DIATHERMY (#❗️ )

- What is the difference between electrocautery and electrosurgery?
    - **Electrosurgery** - via Alternating currents that passes through the tissue
    - **Electrocautery** - via direct current. Current simply heats up the probe and then it is placed on the tissue. No current passes through the tissue. (usually small and battery operated)
- How does diathermy work?
    - A form of **electrosurgery** that Works by high frequency **ALTERNATING** current passing between active electrode and an indifferent electrode or pad.
    - The active electrode has a much smaller surace area, so higher **current density** and higher **temperature**.
    - Because the pad has a larger surface area (70cm2), it does not cause damage when current passes through
- What are the diathermy modes?
    - **Coagulation** - interrupted pulses that produce a **square** wave form
    - **Cutting** - **continuous** current that produces a **sinus** wave form. Cell water is vaporised
    - **Blend** - combination of cogulation and cutting
    - **Fulgaration**/ Spray - coagulation/ charring of tissue over a wide area.
- What is fulguration?
    - Employs a coagulation waveform but with the diathermy held slightly away from tissues
    - Electric arc discharge through **ionised air** gap between electrode and tissue
- ‼️ How to ensure safety of diathermy?
    - Surgeon related
        - Place in quiver when not operating.
        - Do not apply monopolar to end appendages
        - Short bursts in patients with pace makers
        - If use alchohol cleaning, need to dry for at least 5minutes.
    - Plate factors
        - Diathermy pad must be placed on hairless skin, no air to prevent burns
        - No pooling of flammable fluids
        - Away from heart but close to operation site
    - Patient related
        - Removal of all metal obects
        - Managemeng of pace maker
- How manage pace maker intraop?
    - Preop -
        - cardiac technician check, cardiologist check, check what is the mode of the pace maker
        - Inform anaesthesia - depending on mode, sometimes if surgery under the umbilicus, no need to adjust pacemaker
        - Adjust to asynchronus mode so that it will not confuse monopolar use as intrinsic rhythm
    - Intraop
        - Try to use bipolar
        - if using monopolar - use short bursts
        - Stop if any arrythmias
        - Keep magnets on stand by - magnets will activate asynchronus mode and thus pacemaker will trigger a beat irregardless of intrinsic rhythmn
    - Pace Maker
        - Recheck pacemaker and adjust back to previous mode
- How is Bipolar diathermy different?
    - In Bipolar, alternating current is passed from one limb of the forcep to another, through the tissue in between
        - Only has coagulation mode. No cutting mode
    - In monopolar, circuit is completed by the patient and current flows through the patient
- What is Radiofrequency ablation?
    - It is the application of thermal energy via a probe that results in coagulation necrosis of a target tissue
- ‼️ Scope solutions - how does the use of RFA or diathermy affect?
    - If using diathermy ➔ use **water** (it looks like a ball tip - hardly used) [because current is flowing, so cannot use saline]
        
        ![Untitled](29%20Inside%20the%20OT%2067522bce3ee2428ab535145581e0a841/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Radiofrequency ➔ use **Normal saline. [heating only - can use saline]**
- What are the contraindications?
    - No absolute contraindications
    - Avoid placement of pad on metal implants
    - Use bipolar in patients with pacemakers

## OT DESIGN (#❗️ )

- Where should be the OT be placed in the hospital?
    - Close to emergency department and radiology departments
- What are the OT design areas?
    
    ![Untitled](29%20Inside%20the%20OT%2067522bce3ee2428ab535145581e0a841/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - There will be **4 zones - OCAD**
    - **Outer** zone = OT reception and rest of hospital
    - **Clean** zone = OT reception to theatre doors
    - **Aseptic** zone = within OT itself - further divided into
        - Restricted zone (induction and scrub rooms)
        - Aseptic zone (OT itself)
    - **Disposal** zone = separated from other areas
- How do you design a OT?
    - 1. Location within hospital
    - 2. Different areas in OT
    - 3. Within OT
        - Lighting - 40,000 Lux
        - Type of ventilation -
        - Filter, air quality monitoring
        - Temperature 18-23 degrees
- What other factors needs to be considered?
    - Lighting - 40,000 lux at op site
    - Temperature - ideal 18-23 - compromise between patient and staff comfort
    - Humidity - 30-60%
- ‼️ What is laminar flow and what type? What is it opposed to?
    - **Plenum** is air flow down a pressure gradient ➔ subject to turbulence and edies.
    - **Laminar** flow is air flowing in parallel layers with no cross current, eddies or disruption, NO turbulence
    - For air to be laminar flow, it must be at **9mls/hour or 0.3m/s. 200-400 changes per hour!**
    - It can be horizontal (easier to install) or vertical.
    - Vertical laminar flows can cause "**entrainment**" whereby there is entrainment of flow with contamination deflected inwards into the wound.
        
        ![Untitled](29%20Inside%20the%20OT%2067522bce3ee2428ab535145581e0a841/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - This led to the develop of the Howorth enclosure that allows air to flow in the shape of an inverted trumpet, down and out. [aka exponential flow]
        
        ![Untitled](29%20Inside%20the%20OT%2067522bce3ee2428ab535145581e0a841/Untitled%205.png)
        
- What is the ideal OT ventilation?
    - Ideal ventilation is Laminar flow with Howorth enclosure with ultraclean air with HEPA filter.
        
        ![Untitled](29%20Inside%20the%20OT%2067522bce3ee2428ab535145581e0a841/Untitled%206.png)
        
- ‼️ What is the evidence for laminar flow?
    - The landmark study was 1982 by Lidwell (MRC Trial). It found that vertical flow more effective than horizontal flow in joint replacements. Miulticenter study of 8052 joint replacement
    - However, more recent studies have questioned its effectiveness
        - Hooper NZ NJR JBJS 2011 - no significant difference of infection rates with laminar flow or space suits
        - LANCET 2017 Bischoff et al. meta-analysis. No evidence that laminar air flow reduces risk of SSI in replacement and abdominal surgery. Recommend to stop installing.
        - Gastmeier et al. 2012 Journal of hospital infection. Systematic review. No difference in infection rates with or without laminar
        - Pinder et al. NHS hospitals no difference in rates of infection in plenum or laminar flow[https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/full/10.1302/0301-620X.98B9.37184](https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/full/10.1302/0301-620X.98B9.37184)
- What is HEPA filter?
    - It stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air filter
    - Theoretically remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns
    - Modern HEPA filters add in UV light to increase efficiency
- What is the definition of ultra clean air?
    - For laminar system:
        - Air containing less than 10 CFU/m3 (colony forming units) around the theatre table
        - In periphery can be 20 CFU/m3
    - For plenum system - < 35CFU/m3 is considered efficient
- How do you know your OT air is sterile?
    - Passive or Active monitoring done every 3 months
        - **Passive monitoring** (cheaper) using **settle plates**. Standard petri dishes containing culture media are exposed to air for a given time to collect bacteria.
            - 13 plates - 4 corners, 4 lengths, 4 mid diagonal, 1 in center
        - **Active monitoring** uses a **Casella Slit Sampler** that physically draws a known value of air through a particle collection device that can be liquid or solid culture medium - measures as CFU/m3
- What is plenum?
    - It is basically positive pressure ventilation.
    - 15-25 air changes an hour
- Where are the sources of infection in the OT?
    - **Airborne** - 95%
    - Internal - from patient themselves
    - Equipment
        - Clothing - bacterial strike through - direct migration of batereria torugh clothing when

## SCRUBBING AND CLEANSING (#❌ )

- What do you use for scrubbing?
    - I usually use chlorhexidine scrub because:
        - 1. Chlorhexidine decreases bacteria count by 99%, iodine by 97%.
        - 2. Also Chlorhexidine lasts longer than than iodine
        - 3. Chlorhexidine has bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects
    - Cochrane review 2015 Tanner et al. Alcohol rubs at least if not more effective than aqueous scrub.
- Mechanisms of various cleansing solutions?
    - **Iodine** - **bactericidal**, ***active against fungus and viruses***
    - **Chlorhexidine** - disrupts cell membrane; bactericidal and bacteriostatic
    - **Alcohols** - bactericidal, i***nactive against fungus, spores***
    - **Hexodane** = chlrohexidine + alcohol
- What do you wear?
    - "I usually use disposable synthetic, hydrophobic and non-woven polyester clothing which have a mesh size of less than 80microns; to prevent **strike through (**unlike standard cotton which is prone to that)
    - I am aware of woven, reusable materials like Gortex which has pore size of < 0.2microns but it is expensive. "
    - Woven vs non woven/ gortex/dipostable
- What are the types of OT gowns?
    - **Woven vs Non woven**
    - **Woven**
        - **Standard cotton** open weave with large pore size of 80microns, **infefficient at preventing** bacteria migration; Prone to **strike through**
        - **Ventile** - **Cotton** product but closed weaving with much smaller pore size of 20microns, better at preventing bacterial dispersion
        - **Gortex** - woven **polyester** laminted to a film of polytetrafluoroethylene with pore size of **0.2microns**. Very effective barrier but still open structure to allow for some air exchange
    - **Non -woven**
        - **Disposable type** - Appear as a random mat
- What is the evidence for space suits?
    - Body exhaust suits are older tech with a tube; space suits are newer with positive air pressure
    - **Hooper et al. JBJS 2011 NZ NJR** - no difference with space suits.
    - hooper2010.pdf
- What is Strike Through?
    - It is direct migration of bacteria through clothing especially when wet

## Surgical Site Infection (consolidation)

- How do you reduce surgical site infection? (mega question)
    - Pre Op
        - Pre op screening for MRSA kiv decolonization with body wash and repeat nose swab
        - Ensure no active infection
    - Intraop
        - OT design and sterility
            - Proper aseptic zones
            - Ventilation type
                - Quote lidwell study (2x but controversial)
            - Air quality maintenance - regular air quality assessment by active or passive technique (<10 CFU)
        - Pre op systemic abx (4 x)
        - Abx loaded cement (2x)
        - Attire - body suits (2x but controversial), if not body suits - waterpoof,  non woven to prevent strike through
        - NICE intraop guidelines
            - Use iodine impregnanted draps (ioban) if no allergy
            - 2 pairs of gloves
            - use of hexodane (first choice) if skin not next to mucous membrane. second choice is povidone iodine with alcohol.
            
            [Surgical site infections: prevention and treatment](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng125/chapter/recommendations#intraoperative-phase)
            
        - Reduce OT traffic - proper closing of doors, human traffic
        - Equipment - ensure sterility by maintaenance of autoclave, check bovie dick tapes
        - Reduce blood transfusion need by meticulous hemostasis
    - Post op
        - Good wound care and follow up
        - Proper cohorting of patients with isolation of MRSA patients in wards
        - Avoid unneccessary wound dressing change
- Does blood transfusion itself increase infection rates?
    - Yes
