Topic: Knee

- What is the anatomy of the MPFL?
    - It is in the second layer of the medial knee
    - MPFL attached from medial patella to area between adductor tubercle and medial epicondyle
    - Acts as a "check-rein, guiding the patella into trochlear groove at 0-30 °
    - 50% restraining force from 0-30 ° flexion
- Which side does it commonly avulse from?
    - More than one location most common 34%, **Patellar** side only 31%, Femoral side only 14%
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled.png)
        
- What are the clinical findings to ilicit?
    - Look - Valgus, scars
    - Lie down, do knee exam and check special tests
    - **J-sign** when patient extends knee from flexed position, Patella moves superolaterally in an inverted J
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - **Apprehension** test
    - Assess **Patella mobility by Quadrants** [< 2 quadrants]
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - **Beighton Score** (> 6)
    - **Q angle** measurement
        - Angle between 2 lines
        - 1st line from ASIS to midpoint of patella
        - 2nd line from midpoint of patella to tibia tubercle
        - [Males 10-12 °, females 15-18 °]
            
            ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%203.png)
            
    - Assess **Rotational** Profile
- How do you assess rotational profile? 4 components
    - Gait - **Foot progression angle**
        - Walk the patient
        - [-5 - 20 degrees]
        - Increased femoral ante version ➔ Intoeing gait
    - Examination proper - 3 things - Femoral anteversion, tibia torsion, Foot metatarsus adductus
    - **1. Femoral Anteversion** - Craig’s test aka Gage test aka Ryder’s method aka Trochanteric Prominence Angle Test
        - Prone position, knee flexed to 90 degrees
        - One hand over GT; slowly internally rotate the hip (drop the foot outwards)
        - Angle from vertical to palpation of GT at its MOST prominence = ante version angle [20-60 degrees]
        - Antversion about 40 ° at birth and goes to 16 ° at 16 yo.
    - **2. Tibia Torsion -** Thigh Foot angle
        - Prone with knee flexed to 90 [10-20 °]
        - Angle look at is the transcondylar axis of proximal tibia and the bimalleolar axis
            
            ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%204.png)
            
    - **3. Metatarsus Adductus** - Beck's Heel Bisector
        - Normally passes through 2nd web space
            
            ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%205.png)
            
        - Mild = thru 3rd toe
        - Moderate = 3/4 webspace
        - Severe 4/5 webspace
- ‼️ What is the miserable misalignment syndrome?
    - Genu Valgum
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Femoral **Anteversion**
        - When femoral very anteverted, the body compensates by internally rotating the LL to maximise the glute medius length-tension relationship
        - When this happens, the Q angle increases
            
            ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%207.png)
            
    - **External** tibia torsion - in this situation, the tibia tubercle is shifted laterally, and thus Q angle is increased [TTTG distance is increased
    
    ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - *Persistent femoral anteversion can lead to external tibia torsion (compensatory)
- What is the management of miserable malalignment syndrome?
    - “Bilateral double osteotomy” only in severe torsional malalignment has been described in literature
    - Involves ipsilateral outward femoral and inward tibial osteotomes
    
    [Bilateral double osteotomy in severe torsional malalignment syndrome: 16 years follow-up](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033816/)
    
- What initial investigations?
    - XR - AP, Lateral Skyline ➔ look for loose body (can come form lateral femoral condyle)
    - KIV MRI if suspect loose body, TRO meniscus and ACL injury
- Management of patella 1st time dislocator?
    - If no loose body ➔ controversial but generally accepted to have a trial non operative physiotherapy for VMO strengthening.
    - If loose body ➔ arthroscopic removal/ fixation depending on size (2cm)
- Surgery for first time dislocator?
    - Controversial. I assess the patient risk of recurrence by using validated score such as the **Patellar instability severity score, published by Peter Balcarek in KSSTA** in 2013 based on 61 patients.
    - Score looks at - age < 16, Bilateral instability, trochlea dysplasia, patella height, TTTG, Patellar tilt. Score out of 7
        - 4 or more points - Odds ratio is 5 x higher than < 4

            [PISS.pdf](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/PISS.pdf)
            
    - I will counsel the patient and parent accordingly for an informed decision
    - Systematic review by Erickson et al. 2015 found lower re-dislocation rates (24% vs 34%) but no different in outcomes
    
    [erickson-doe-operative-treatment-first-time-patellar-dislocations-lead-increased-stability-arhtroscopy-2015 (2).pdf](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/erickson-doe-operative-treatment-first-time-patellar-dislocations-lead-increased-stability-arhtroscopy-2015_(2).pdf)
    
- Where is the osteochondral lesion usually from?
    
    ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    - It can be either from the medial aspect of patella facet or lateral femoral condyle

## RECURRENT DISLOCATOR

- Investigations for reccurent dislocator?
    - CT scan - TTTG distance > 20mm
    - MRI - Looking for MPFL, TRO ACL, TRO Meniscus
    - XR long film - assess valgus
- How do you objectively measure Patellar Alta?
    
    ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2011.png)
    
    ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    - Many methods but I use the Caton Dechamps Method because it is independant on the flexion of the knee.
    - Length of Articular surface of patella divided by Distance between inferior articular surface of patella to anterior articular surface of tibia
    - Normal **0.6-1.3**
    - **Insall Salvati** Length of patella tendon divided by Length of patella [~1]
    - **Blackburne Peel**
    
    ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2013.png)
    
- ‼️ ⚠️ How do you assess for trochlea dysplasia?
    - Dejour Classification - can be assed on XR lateral and MRI/CT axial
        - SFCC
    - Type A = **Crossing** sign (CT shows **shallow** trochlea < 145 °)
    - B = Crossing **+ Supratrochle**a spur (CT show **flat** trochlea)
    - C = Crossing **+ double contour** (CT shows medial hypoplasia **convex** trochlea)
    - D = **All 3** (CT shows a **cliff** from lateral trochlea)
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2014.png)
        
- Why are there these signs?
    - Usually the LFC and MFC they coincide on lateral XR
    - Crossing sign - deepest point of the trochlear sulcus crossing the anterior border of the femoral condyles
    - Supratrochlear spur - prominence of the trochlea on the anterior aspect of the femoral cortex
    - Double Contour - hypoplastic medial facet
- How do you assess for Patella dysplasia?
    - **Wiberg** Classification on skyline XR
    - 1 = symmetrical lateral and medial facet
    - 2 = L > M facet
    - 3 = Medial facet markedly smaller
    - 4 = no medial facet
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2015.png)
        
- **Management** of patella reccurent dislocator?
    - No consensus on the optimal treatment
    - Ala-carte method depending on the anatomical risk factors for the patient
    - **5 main procedures**
    - **3 bony** Tibia tuberosity transfer, Trochleoplasty, in severe genu valgum - distal femoral osteotomy (DFO).
    - **2 soft tissue** - MPFL reconstruction (acts as a checkrein), lateral release
- What is the technique for **MPFL** reconstruction
    - Identify Schottle's point (femoral insertion)
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2016.png)
        
        - 1st line = posterior cortex of femur
        - 2nd = perpendicular line at transition of curve of posterior condyle
        - 3rd = perpendicular line at posterior aspect of blumensaat line
    - Patella tunnel - multiple configurations
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2017.png)
        
- Is Isolated MPFL reconstruction sufficient?
    - Controversial but evidence shows it is sufficient regardless of TTTG, Patella Alta or Trochlea dysplasia (All-comers) (Erickson et al. Cohort study of 90 patients.)
    
    [Erickson MPFL.pdf](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Erickson_MPFL.pdf)
    
- What is the evidence for **lateral release**?
    - Isolated lateral release - controversial
    - Recent meta-analysis by Tan et al. 2020 found good outcomes but recommend good selection. **Patients with > 5 dislocations, ligamentous laxity** = high failure rates
    - Consensus is to do as part of a secondary procedure.
    
    [tan2019.pdf](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/tan2019.pdf)
    
- What are the types of **Tibial tuberosity transfers**?
    - **Fulkerson** - AM
    - Macquet - anterior only
    - Elmsie-Trillat - medialize only
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2018.png)
        
- Options for Skeletally immature patient?
    - **Roux- Goldthwait** technique = Transfer of lateral patella tendon across to medial aspect to change force vector
        
        ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2019.png)
        

![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2020.png)

- What is the **Hauser** Procedure?
    - It was a old procedure which did not have good outcomes
    - it involved removing the patella tendon with a **small bone block of 2 x 2cm and reinserted medially by 1cm medial and distally**
    - It is then sutured down and patient kept in plaster for 4-6 weeks before beginning flexion.

## CONGENITAL PATELLA INSTABILITY

- What are the types of congenital patella instability?
    - **Habitual/ Obligatory** = 2 kinds
        - Flexion type - Dislocates ***whenever*** knee flexed and spontaneous relocates with extension
            
            ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2022.png)
            
            ![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2023.png)
            
        - Extension type - opposite
    - **Congenital/ Permanent** = persists in dislocation in all positions; cannot be reduced manually
- What is the etiology?
    - **4 categories - Small patella, tight muscle, loose soft tissue, trochlea dysplasia**
    - Patella hypoplasia or absence - nail patella syndrome
    - Quadriceps contractures - arthrogyposis
    - Excessive lax musculature - Larsen's syndrome, Down's syndrome
    - Trochlea ACplasia
- What is the cardinal sign?
    - When patella held forcibly in midline, it is impossible to flex knee more than 30-70°. Further flexion only possible when patella allowed to dislocate
    - Usually painless
- Management of congenital patella instability?
    - Surgical objective is to "realign the extensor mechanism" and depends if flexion or extension type and etiology.
        - If flexion type ➔ usually **Tight quadriceps** ➔ Lateral release, Quads lengthening, Routh-gothwaite procedure
        - If extension type ➔ usually **Trochlea dysplasia** ➔ Trochleoplasty, MPFL recon, Elmsie Trillat medializing osteotomy
- Proximal release technique for flexion type?
    - Extensile lateral incision along ITB
    - Release ITB and VL from patella
    - Rectus femoris lengthening procedures e.g. Z lengthening
    - Advancement of VMO across anterior surface of patella to change force vector
    - If still insufficient ➔ distal TT transfer
- ‼️ What are syndromes/ Dysplasias associated with patella instability?
    - Larsen’s Syndrome
    - Nail Patella Syndrome
    - MED/ SED - leading to valgus knee  and patella instability
    - Ehler Danlos, Marfans

## Congenital Knee Dislocation

![Untitled](Patella%20Instability%2031cc0dee3d574bd78e29bf27eaf53fdd/Untitled%2024.png)

- How you evaluate this child?
    - Look for other joint involvement - arthrogryposis
    - Check NV - tickle feet, check pulse (unlikely)
    - Check **Spine** - for myelomeningocele
    - Check if reducible, check stability
- What is it caused by?
    - Packaging disorder
    - Check US records
- What association?
    - Larsen, Arthrogryposis, Ehlers Danlos
    - Myelomeingocele
- Screen for other packaging disorders?
    - 
- ‼️ What classification?
    - **Tarek** classification - need XR
        - Grade 1 simple **recurvatum** - PROM > 90
        - Grade 2 **Subluxation** - 30-90
        - Grade 3 **Dislocation** < 30
- Management?
    - Treatment is a trial of reduction with manual manipulation and casting until the age of 3 months.
    - Surgical management is indicated in cases of failure to gain 30° of flexion after 3 months of casting.
