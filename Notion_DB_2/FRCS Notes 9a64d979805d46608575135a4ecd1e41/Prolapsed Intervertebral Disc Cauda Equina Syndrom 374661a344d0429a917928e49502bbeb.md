- What causes the pain in PID?
    - 3 sources of pain:
        - **Discogenic** pain as annulus and PLL innervated by sinuvertebral nerve from ventral ramus
            
            
            - Innervation of the disc?
                
                ![Untitled](15%20Intervertebral%20Disc%2086bf71b662a746e3a8f8aedf11775172/Untitled.png)
                
                - Dorsal Ramus gives rise to **medial branch** supplying facet joins
                - Ventral Ramus gives rise to:
                    - 1. **Sinuvertebral** nerve (from ventral ramus) ➔ posterior annulus, Dura, PLL
                    - 2. **Gray ramus Communicans** (from sympathetic ganglion)➔ anterior annulus, ALL
                - Only the **outer third** of a healthy annulus is innervted. Inner two-thirds is completely avascular and aneural

        - **Chemicals** causing pain - phospholipase A2, Interleukins 1, 2, TNF alpha
        - **Radicular** pain from nerve compression
- Most common level?
    - L4/5 then L5/S1
        - (degenerative Spondylolisthesis is also L4/5. Dysplastic is L5/S1)
- ‼️ Classification of Disc?
    - Morphology - **BPES**
        - Disc bulge - diffuse symmetrical oupouching of annulus fibrosus
        - Protrusion – intact AF - Base > AP dimension
        - Extrusion – AF disrupted - AP dimension > base
        - Sequestered – not continuous
            
            ![Untitled](Prolapsed%20Intervertebral%20Disc%20Cauda%20Equina%20Syndrom%20374661a344d0429a917928e49502bbeb/Untitled.png)
            
    
    - Location of Spinal stenosis? (also for disc)
        - CLFE
        - **Central** stenosis - will hit traversing roots
        - **Lateral recess aka subarticular** = begins at the medial border of the superior articular process and extends to the medial border of the pedicle - will hit traversing roots aka **" paracentral"** when used to describe disc
        - **Foraminal recess [Mid-zone]**  = between medial and lateral border of pedicles - hit exiting roots
        - **Extra-foraminal/ Far lateral recess [Exit zone]** = lateral to lateral border of pedicle - exitting roots
            
            ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled.png)

    - On the MRI axial cut, which is the SAP?
        - It is the process anteriorly
        
        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - SAP is on the outside
        
        ![Untitled](Prolapsed%20Intervertebral%20Disc%20Cauda%20Equina%20Syndrom%20374661a344d0429a917928e49502bbeb/Untitled%201.png)
        
- Which location of prolapse disc is most common? Why?
    - Paracentral aka lateral recess 90-95%!
    - PLL is weakest here
- What kind of neurology pattern in Cervical spine vs Lumbar spine?
    - 1. Pedicle/nerve root mismatch
        - Cervical spine C6 nerve root travels under C5 pedicle (mismatch)
        - Lumbar spine L5 nerve root travels under L5 pedicle (match)
    - 2. Horizontal (cervical) vs. vertical (lumbar) anatomy of nerve root
        - Lumbar spine - paracentral disc and foraminal disc will affect traversing root
        - C-spine - central and foraminal disc will affect the same nerve root
- What are the nerve root tension signs?
    - Straight leg raise
    - Lesague's - foot dorsiflexion
    - Bow string sign = flex knee, then compress popliteal fossa
    - Contralateral SLR - central disc herniation
- How to differentiate Conus medullaris vs Cauda Equina?
    - **Conus Medullaris**
        - More proximal as end at **L1**
        - More symmetrical
        - Presence of UMNL signs - clonus, down going babinski
    - **Cauda Equina**
        - Weakness more distal
        - Asymmetry
        - No UMNL signs
- What is the natural history of lumbar prolapse?
    - Based on the North American Spine Society NASS workgroup systematic review
    - 50% recover in 1 month, 80% significant improvement in 3 month
- Non op Management?
    - Analgesia, PT
    - Nerve root block
- How do you do a open lumbar discectomy?
    - P - prone on wilson frame to open up interlaminar space
    - Localise with II
    - I - midline incision down to supraspinous ligament
        - Paraspinal muscles retracted laterally (preserve joint capsule)
        - Ligamentum flavum incised and window created
        - Laminotomy on inferior edge of upper lamina

    - Locate and protect nerve root
    - Look for sequestered disc if present
- Must you always do laminotomy for discectomy?
    - Yes - you can do L5/S1 (widest) discectomy via **Fenestration** of the ligamentum flavum
    - Yes - you can do far lateral disc via wiltse approach and avoid laminectomy
- Complications of discectomy?
    - Dural tears - get help from Neurosurgery
    - nerve root injury
    - Epidural bleeding,
    - Infection, discitis
- Microdiscectomy vs Open discectomy?
    - Micro - shorter hospital stay, lower pain scores
    - No difference in post op pain, occupational impact or recurrence

- What are some evidence for surgery for disc herniation?
    - Aware of the SPORT Trial and the Maine Lumbar Spine Study
    - **SPORT** trial was a RCT of 501 patients.
        - Intention to treat analysis - no difference
        - As-treated analysis shows significantly greater improvement in pain, function, satisfaction over **8 years.**
        - However **High cross over rates of up to 60%** thus observed effects for Intention-to-treat was small.
    - **MLSS** was a cohort study of 500 patients
        - Patients with sciatica found to respond better with surgery at 1 and 4 year follow up but employment outcomes similar
        - No difference in back pain
        - Revision rates lower at **10 years** 23% vs 39%
- What do you know of the Maine Lumbar Spine Study (MLSS)?
    - Robert Keller et al. Evaluate effectiveness of surgery for herniated lumbar disc
    - Prospective cohort study; not randomized ; 507 patients
    - Compared op vs non op; Patients who underwent op [Open discectomy] had worse symptoms based on Sciatic Bothersome Index
        
        ![Untitled](Prolapsed%20Intervertebral%20Disc%20Cauda%20Equina%20Syndrom%20374661a344d0429a917928e49502bbeb/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Patients with **sciatica** reported substantially better outcomes with surgery at 1 year and 4 year follow up BUT employment outcomes similar
    - At 10 years, op vs non op similar improvement in low back pain, satisfaction BUT better leg pain and functional scores
    - Surgery lower revision rates at 10 years (23% vs 39%)
    - Surgery had little advantage for those with little symptoms

- How do you consent for XXX?
    - I will consent by discussing with patient the indications, alternatives, risks and expectations of outcomes
    - **Indications** - prevent OA/ neurology/ paralysis/ halt progression
    - **Alternatives** - non operative but may get worse
    - **Risks** - GA vs Specific; Early vs Late
    - **Expectations** of outcomes - wound healing, bone healing,

## THORACIC DISC HERNIATION

- What are the approaches to the thoracic disc
    - **Transpedicular via posterior approach (Jon tan)**
        - Remove pedicle and part of the rib
        - May need to sacrifice an intercostal nerve root
        
        ![Untitled](Prolapsed%20Intervertebral%20Disc%20Cauda%20Equina%20Syndrom%20374661a344d0429a917928e49502bbeb/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Transthoracic (anterior approach) - most preferred. Can be either open or thoracoscopic
    - Lateral extracavitary
    - Costotransversectomy

### Cauda Equina Syndrome

- ⚠️ What are the stages of Cauda Equina Syndrome?
    - Based on the British Association of Spinal Surgery: [SIR]
    - **CES - Suspected [Flaccid without sphincter dysfunction]**
        - Defined as suspected CES with INTACT sphincter function
    - **CES - Incomplete [CESS + dysuria, urgency and altered urinary sensation]**
        - NPU for > 6 hours. Loss of desire to void, poor stream, strain to micturate, sensation of full bladder
    - **CES - Retention [+ painless retention of urine and overflow incontinence]**
        - Characterised by painless urinary retention and overflow incontinence

- What is the classic triad of cauda equina syndrome?
    - Saddle anaesthesia
    - bowel and/or bladder dysfunction,
    - and lower extremity weakness.
- Significance of the stages of CES?
    - It is believed that intervention when in CES-I stage have better prognosis. Try to decompress before progression into CES-R
    - However, It may be more appropriate to consider CES as the progression of a continuous process with the end result possible dysfunction of bowel and bladder function. In addition prolonged compression can be associated with further neurologic loss even after CESR

- What is the timing we ought to decompress?
    - The earlier the decompression the better.
    - Try to avoid getting into CES-R stage
    - Due to late presentation, patients usually get operation after 24 hours, so try to do before 48 hours
