- What is the incidence of TB Hip?
    - Only second to TB spine
- Clinical features of TB Hip?
    - Discharging sinuses, puckered scars, LLD
    - **Gauvain's sign** in early TB Hip - on IR of hip, muscles around the hip and lower abdominal goes into spasm
    - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keW9KT4IIeI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keW9KT4IIeI)
- ‼️ What are the stages of TB Hip?
    - **Tuli Classification**
        - **Synovitis** - haziness, apparent lengthening
        - **Early Arthritis** - no reduction in joint space, due to muscle spasm. Hip in Flexion, adduction and IR → apparent shortening
        - **Advanced arthritis** - reduction in joint space, true shortening
        - Advanced Arthritis with **subluxation**

- How to investigate?
    - Tissue biopsy of the hip joint
    - MRI with contast
- ‼️ XR features of TB Hip?
    - Radiolucencies in Babcock's triangle (inferior aspect of femoral neck)

    - **"Wandering acetabuli"** - Femoral head displaces upwards, leaving the lower part of acetbulum empty

    - **"Mortar and pestle Acetabuli"** - femoral head grossly destroyed and contained in a large acetabuli

- Can we do THR for patient with TB Hip?
    - Traditionally **2 forms of treatment** - Arthrodesis vs Excision arthroplasty
    - SOme consider THR to be contraindicated due to too high risk of activation
    - However, more studies done on doing THR in patients with ACTIVE TB
- When can we do the THR for patient with TB hip?
    - Controversial
    - Long period of quiescence up to 10 years has been reccomended
    - Some operate on active TB between 3-6 months of disease with Anti TB medications pre and post op
    - Most agree that sinus drainage is contraindication
- How will you do THR in a TB hip?
    - Complex primary
    - Preop
        - Anaesthesia review
        - Templating - LLD
        - Stand by implants - plan for cemented **[some authors suggest cement thermal reaction can reduce reactivation]**
        - Ensure CXR - no lung involvement
    - Intraop
        - Exposure - extensile posterior approach KIV releases
        - Insitu neck cut if unable to dislocate due to contracture
        - Complete curretage and debridement of infected tissues
        - No evidence for mixing anti-TB drugs into cement
    - Post Op
        - **Anti-TB chemotherapy** for 6 months to 1 year to prevent reactivation
- What is special about TB compared to other bacteria in terms of instrumentation?
    - TB does not adhere to metal surface and has little or no biofilm formation
    - Rifampicin, given as part of anti TB regime is also able to penetrate biofilm if any
- Any difference between cemented vs cementless implants in TB Hip?
    - Cemented vs cementless no difference in studies
    - Though some think the thermal reaction helps reduce reactivation
- Management of reactivation of TB hip post replacement?
    - Controverisal
    - Some reccomend removal of prosthesis for control of reactivation
    - Some treat with chemotherapy alone

## Hip Fusion and Conversion

- What are the options for hip fusion?
    - Extra-articular - cobra plate (no screws across the joint)
    - Transarticular - screws across the joint

- How do you denude the cartilage?
    - Acetabulum - reamer
    - Head - use a burr
- What is the position of fusion for the hip?
    - The preferred position of the hip for the arthrodesis was 20 to 25 degrees of flexion, neutral abduction-adduction, and neutral rotation.
    - Preserve abductors for later conversion to THR
- What are common indications for hip fusion?
    - salvage for **failed** THA (most common)
    - **young active laborers** with painful unilateral ankylosis after infection or trauma
    - **neuropathic** arthropathy
    - **tumor** resection
- What are the complications of hip fusion? Incidence of back pain?
    - 33 patients evaluated after 26-52 years, **75% developed back pain**
    - Back pain started average after 24 years
    - Ipsilateral knee pain; Contralateral hip and knee pain also occur

---

- What are the reasons for hip fusion conversion?
    - Pain in ipsilateral knee, back
    - Pain in contralateral hip
    - Painful nonunion or malposition hip fusion
    - **Need to ensure origin of pain is accurately identified and function of patient ascertained
- What must you rule out before conversion?
    - Need to find out reason for original fusion
    - Rule out ongoing infection
    - If infection ➔ 2 stage procedure
- How will you convert hip fusion to THR?
    - “Complex Revision” - taken from Whitehouse et al. JBJS technique paper 2013

    - Pre op
        - Find out reason for fusion - if there is previous or ongoing **infection**
        - **Anaesthesia** to evaluate for long op
        - Assess **abductor function** by 3 ways:
            - **Clinically** - ask patient to attempt hip abduction and feel for hip contraction
            - **EMG** - for abductor function. If negative, counsel for poor outcomes
            - **MRI -** also can use MRI to assess abductor mass
        - Templating LLD, long leg films, CT scan for bone stock
        - Stand by **II** - may be required to identify positioning of reaming
        - Stand by **implants** - dual mobility, constrained hips
        - Consider **uncemented** tapered stem to due to multiple screw holes and to avoid stress riser
    - Intraop
        - Posterior approach KIV extensile
        - **Napking ring osteotomy**
        - Identify and Protect **sciatic** nerve carefully (may be difficult due to scarring)
        - if GT is still defined with abductors attached ➔ **Trochanteric osteotomy** with careful preservation of **superior gluteal nerve**
        - Identify the “**pubofemoral** arch” as a landmark for osteotomy of the neck
        - Acetabulum prep -
        - Consider **dual mobility** implants or **constrained** liner if any doubts of soft tissue integrity
    - Post op
        - Active abduction avoided for 6 weeks

- What is this?
    - This is a historic procedure, form of extra-articular arthrodesis
    - **Iliofemoral arthrodesis.** Flap of bone is turned down from the outer table of the ilium with the iliac attachment unbroken at the lower border and upper end is implanted into the GT.
