Topic: Hip

- ‼️ What is the difference between PE cup creep and wear?
    - Creep is normal loading of the polyethylene cup and is **superomedial**.
    - It is normal to see slight thinning in the area of the weight bearing as the plastic moulds itself. Abnormal loading leads to pressure more laterally, resulting in polyethylene wear on the **superolateral** side.

- What is most common reason for THR revision?
    - Reasons for revision (based on UKNJR) - most common is aseptic loosening.
    - All primary THR – **Aseptic loosening** > Pain > instability
    - < 1 year THR – **Instability** > fracture > infection > aseptic loosening
    - > 1 year – **aseptic loosening** > pain > infection > instability
- How are you going to approach this patient? (Triple assessment TRO infection)
    - TRO **INFECTION**!
    - TRO **Extrinsic** causes of pain!
    - Features of loosening - start up pain
    - Classic features
        - Pain on IR/ ER - femoral component loosening
        - Groin pain with resisted SLR - Acetabular loosening
    - **Hx =**
        - Features of sepsis - fever, pain
        - Duration of symptoms? interval pain free since op?
        - Features of pain - start up? groin/ buttock? (acetabulum), thigh (stem)?
        - Function
        - Co-morbids
        - initial op - op notes, wound issues? abx suppression?
        - OTHER CAUSES OF THIGH PAIN - spine
    - **PE**
        - Inspection of wound, sinus/ redness
        - Gait - trendelenburg
        - LLD?
        - Check ROM, NV
- What Invx?
    - Bloods - TRO infection FBC, CRP, ESR
    - XR - AP/Lateral
    - Long leg films
    - CT scan - extent of loosening, bone stock
    - Aspiration if any concerns of infection
- Features of XR to mention?
    - Regards to the acetabular component
        - Acetabular **tear drop** - integrity of medial wall
        - **Kohler** line (ilioischial) - integrity of medial wall
        - **Ischial** lysis - integrity of posterior column
        - **Vertical** migration - integrity of superior dome
        - Extent of migration - < 2 or > 2cm

    - Regards to femur component
        - extent of metaphyseal/ diaphysis lysis

## CEMENTED HIP Failure

- What are the modes of cemented stem failure?
    - Gruen's Mode of failure
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%201.png)
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - 1 = Pistoning A and B
        - 1A = pistoning in cement
        - 1B = cement pistoning
    - 2 = Medial midstem pivot = distal + calcar toggling. (Both proximal and distal loosening)
    - 3 = Calcar pivot = distal toggling, but proximal stable (ONLY distal loosening)
    - 4 = Bending cantilever = implant break at neck due to fatigue failure
- What are the reasons for broken cement mantle?
    - This is an issue of fatigue failure due to cyclic stresses at the cement mantle
    - This can be described with an S-n curve.
    - Stresses experienced at the cement mantle that exceed the fatigue endurance limit of both the stem–cement interface and the cement material itself.
- How to prevent cement mantle fracture?
    - 1. Good alignment - avoid varus. Varus leads to thin cement mantle in the proximal medial (Gruen zone 7) and distal lateral (Gruen zone 3) zones
    - 2. No cement voids - mix in vacuum and pressurization (3rd gen)
    - 3. Good cement mantle >2mm - use centralizers (3rd gen)
    - However, aware of the **french paradox**, with regards to cement mantle width. [What is the french paradox?](https://workflowy.com/#/fda755cdb1ff)

## CEMENTLESS HIP Failure

- How do we know if the **cementless** stem if stable or not? (planning for extraction)
    - Assess as per **Glassman and Engh 1992**
    - Divides fixation modes into 3; implications = will determine ease of extraction
        - If Stable and fibrous = cannot be removed by simple disimpaction ➔ need ETO and burr
    - **Stable fixation** = no subsidence, enodosteal hypertrophy (**spot weld**), proximal atrophy [stress sheilding means good fixation!] , no reactive lines
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled.png)
        
    - **Stable fibrous encapsulation** = no subsidence or stabilize in 1 year, parallel reactive lines, minimal proximal atrophy
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - **Unstable fixation** = progressive subsidence, toggle, hypertrophy at collar at stem tip, **pedestal** formation (pedestaling) , canal enlargement ➔ usually unstable
- What are the signs of loosening in femoral stems? [SOA]
    - **Uncemented** - subsidence, pedestaling, progressive radiolucenct lines, fracture
    - **Cemented** - cement mantle fracture, implant position change, radioluscent lines

## REVISION PRINCIPLES

- ‼️ How do you classify Acetabular bone loss?
    - Looking at 4 lines - Kohler (ilioischial line), Roof, Tear drop and ischial lysis
    - Acetabulum = **Paprosky**
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - 1 = Minimal “**undistorted** hemispherical acetabulum”
        - 2 = **Migration < 2cm; “Distorted acetabulum with intact columns**
            - A - Superomedial
            - B - Superolateral
            - C – Medial - Protrusio but does not go pass kohler line
        - 3 = **Migration > 2cm  ; “Distorted and non supportive columns”**
            - 3A = **“Up and Out”**
                - **Moderate** ischial lysis
                - Medial tear drop intact
                - Intact ilioischial and iliopubic lines
            - 3B = “up and in” - pelvic **discontinuity**
                - **Broken** Kohler’s line
                - **Extensive** ischial osteolysis
                - Loss of tear drop
                - High risk of occult pelvic discontinuity
                
                ![Screenshot 2022-07-13 at 8.01.17 AM.png](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Screenshot_2022-07-13_at_8.01.17_AM.png)
                
        - Pelvic discontinuity
        - Fracture line through both columns
    
    ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%204.png)
    
- How to you classify Femur bone loss?
    - **Paprosky**
    
    ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - 1 = minimal
    - 2 = extensive metaphyseal loss, diaphysis intact
    - 3A = diaphyseal loss > 4cm left
    - 3B = diaphyseal loss < 4cm left
    - 4 = totally no support in diaphysis
- ‼️ How do you to a THR revision for osteolysis/ broken implant?
    - "This is a complex revision case, divide in to 3 phases"
    - Goals are implant stability and hip stability
    - **Pre op**
        - Anaesthetic review - comorbids, fitness for anaesthesia
        - Templating
        - CT scan - to evaluate bone stock
        - **Standby** extraction tools
            - **“Moreland Extraction”** set - comes with tools for removal
            - “Trephination set” - core reamers to allow reaming into broken distal stem to remove
            - **Cemented** - remove stems, then remove cement mantle OSCAR US Cement removal system (if not removing cement, consider cement on cement reviion
            - **CEMENTLESS** - Microsagittal saw blade, flexible thin osteotomes
                
                ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%206.png)
                
                ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%207.png)
                
            - Acetabular Explant tool
                
                ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%208.png)
                
        - Stand by **implants** (need to apply algorithm based on paprosky)
            - Acetabular - stand by structural grafts to augment lateral acetabulum, stand by augments if 3B, stand by triflange cage-cup constructs,
            - Femur - principle is to bypass most distal defect by 2 x cortical diameter
    - Intraop - EEE, RRR
        - **Exposure** – choose extensile posterior approach, release glute max, psoas tendon prepare for **ETO (extended trochanteric osteotomy)** - usually not needed as based on Engh paper, unstable fixation - easy to remove
            - Longitudinal cut 12-15cm from GT
            - Transverse cut leaving 2/3 of diameter
            - Prophylactic cerclage 1cm below to prevent propogation
        - **Extraction** WHILE PREVENTING PROX FEMUR FRACTURE –
            - **CEMENTED** - Use OSCAR ultrasound cement removal system, use screw to remove the PE, flexible osteotomes
                - If cemented ➔ can consider cement on cement
            - **CEMENTLESS** - "usually easy to remove as described by Engh as this XR is that of unstable fixation, usually no need ETO". if not, goal is to PREVENT A PROXIMAL FEMUR FRACTURE
                - Based on Glassman and Engh's Experience in 1992
                    - If XR shows unstable ➔ likely no need ETO
                    - If XR shows stable fixation ➔ ETO likely
                - Next, I will remove all granulation tissue around neck
                - Test stability, by having the extraction device attached to implant; give 4-5 firm blows. If not moving = STABLE ➔ move on to divide the bone-implant interface
                - Pencil burr or microsagittal saw to cut as far distally as possible
                - Then use a thin flexible osteotome to create a plane between bone and implant
                - Remove implant with a vice grip holder or a device around the collar
        - **Examine** – assess bone loss
        - **Reconstruct** – KIV bone grafts from iliac crest
        - **Replace** – based on paprosky
        - **Rehabilitation** – allow gentle TTWB with f/u XR
    - Post op
        - Rehab - TTWB with F/U XR
- **What options for implantation?**
    - **Implant Options – Cup (Miller’s = 85% can revise with HS cup)**
        - **1** = **Hemispherical** cup
        - **2A** = Metal Augments or Structural graft e.g. bulk femoral head + **hemispherical** cup
        - **2B** = restore superolateral loss with Metal Augments or Structural graft e.g. bulk femoral head + **hemispherical** cup (like DDH)
        - **2C** = restore medial bone stock with Metal Augments or Structural graft e.g. bulk femoral head + **hemispherical** cup OR cup on cup revision with smaller cup to act as medial augment.
        - **3A** =
            - Replace defect with metal augments (Trabecular metal cup/ oblong cups/ jumbo cups (> 60mm)), column augment with screw fixation.
            - OR bone graft (ICBG + mesh + cemented cup)
        - **3B** **= pelvic discontinuity** = Tri-flange cage- cup construct with flanges to ilium, ischium, pubis
            - Put the cup. Then cage on the cup. Then PE cemented into the cup
            - Acts as a scaffold for structural amd moresellized bone graft
    - **Implant Options – Stem**
        - **Key principle** = need to bypass the most distal defect by *2 x cortical diameter*
        - 1 = Extensively coated stem
        - 2 = Extensively coated calcar replacement stem
        - 3A = **Long modular tapered** stem (distal fixation)
        - 3B = Impaction Bone grafting (IBG) with cemented polished stem +/- cortical strut allograft
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Revision%20Ceramic%20Failure%20233b35315f3f4e4d89399dce12100489/Untitled%209.png)
            
        - 4 = IBG with cemented stem, Megaprosthesis, Allograft- Prosthetic Composite (APC)
- Strategies to address instablity in revision THR?
    - Optimize component positioning
    - Restore anatomy - offset
    - Increase head/ neck ratio
    - Constrained liner (aka captive cup)
    - Convert to bipolar hemiarthroplasty
    - Dual mobility bearing

## Ceramic Catastrophic Failure

- How does the ceramic cup (or any brittle material) fail? (Ceramic Castastrophic Failure)
    - Ceramic is a brittle material, and fails by **Crack initiation** and **propagation**
        1. Microscopic cracks can occur from stress
        2. Cracks may become **critical size** and it 
        3. Propagates through the structure in a fast manner, failing suddenly
    - It fails suddenly, soon after the yield point.
    - This is opposed to a ductile material where the cracks keeps getting bigger until the remaining area cannot support the load.
- What investigation?
    - CT scan

- ‼️ How do you manage ceramic catastrophic failure?
    - “Complex Revision”
    - Pre op
        - Prepare explant equiment
        - Another full implant set in case need to change all components
        - Revise as soon as possible to prevent ceramic fragments from damaging metal tapers further
        - Interim, patient must not weight bear to prevent damage to taper
    - Exposure - extensile posterior approach
    - Extraction
        - Profuse joint lavage to remove damaged ceramic liner without scratching metal shell of acetabular component
        - Require extensive synovectomy to remove as many ceramic components as possible
        - Replace both components even if only one component failed
    - Examine for **damage** and **alignment**
        - If stem morse taper damaged ➔ need to revise stem
        - If cup damaged but stable ➔ revise cup; if it is too hazardous to revise whole cup, then use XLPE (plan for ceramic on PE)
        - If any mal-alignment, replace as poor orientation can lead to impingement and failure.
    - Reconstruct Bone defect if any
    - Replace
        - Bearing choice is controversial
        - Some authors suggest to replace ceramic head again ➔ same hardness to prevent 3rd body wear and not for metal head because small ceramic particles will ALWAYS remain and can lead to 3rd body wear of a metal head
            - Other option is **XPLE** on **Ceramic**
            - XLPE on metal is not reccomended
    - Rehab
