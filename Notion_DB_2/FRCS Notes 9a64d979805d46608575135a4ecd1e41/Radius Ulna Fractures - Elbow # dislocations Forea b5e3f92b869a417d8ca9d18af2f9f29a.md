## Olecranon Fractures

- Classification of olecranon fractures?
    - **Mayo**
    - 1 = displaced
    - 2 = Displaced; stable
    - 3 = Displaced with subluxation of ulnohumeral joint
    - Modifiers: A = stable; B = comminuted
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled.png)
        
- Management?
    - Simple = Tension Band wiring
    - Comminuted = Plating
- Plate vs tension band for simple fracture?
    - **Cochrane review Matar et al. 2014** – insufficient evidence to draw conclusion
    - Andrew Duckworth et al. RCT of 67 patients
        - Outcomes similar
        - **TBW increased implant removal** (63% vs 38%)
        - But plate higher risk of infection and revision
    - “As such, I will opt for the more cost effective tension band wiring in simple olecranon fractures while counselling patient the possible need for subsequent implant removal”

## Simple Elbow Dislocation

- What gives stability to elbow?
    - [22. Shoulder and Elbow Biomech](22%20Shoulder%20and%20Elbow%20Biomech%200f33cdc5099346d8a68018d8e7227503.md)
- What are the stages of dislocation?
    - Circle of Horii
    - PLRI  ➔ Anterior and posterior capsule [Perched] ➔ Medial ligaments [Elbow Dislocation]
    
    ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%201.png)
    
    ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%202.png)
    
- What is the classic mechanism of elbow dislocation?
    - Supination (or external rotation) with valgus and axial compression during flexion as described by **O’driscoll**
- Which direction of elbow dislocation most common? Which direction can be concerning?
    - **Posterolateral** 90%
    - Posteromedial is very rare < 1% - associated with more severe soft tissue injury
- Which portion does the LUCL commonly fail?
    - Most commonly at the proximal (humerus) origin
    - McKee study - of 62 patients,
        - 32 are avulsion from humerus
        - 5 bony avulsions from humerus
        - Midsubstance in 18,
        - Ulnar detachment in 3
        - ulnar bony avulsion in 1
- ‼️ If nerve involvement which nerve?
    - Median nerve, **AIN** (same as a Supra conylar injury posterolateral pattern)
- What stage is a complete dislocation?
    - Definitely stage 3 circle of Horii
- How you reduce elbow dislocation?
    - "2 person technique"
    - Patient lie supine
    - Arm flexed
    - One person traction on forearm
    - I will then apply pressure with my thumb over the olecranon process
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%203.png)
        
- Management of Simple dislocation?
    - Mx (Hackl et al. 2015 Systematic Review)
    - Recommend short term **immobilization of 1 week** and begin functional **therapy** to prevent stiffness
    - Follow up in clinic for repeat XR and assessment for stability ➔ check XR
    - 75% able to return to previous sports at 12 months
    - If unstable, can consider either op or hinged brace for further immob
- What if elbow is persistently unstable?
    - Will require MRI to further evaluate
    - SOA in June 2022 - possible more severe soft tissue injury including triceps avulsion, common extensor origin avulsions and common flexor origin avulsions
    - Especially in posteromedial direction
- How do you know if elbow is unstable when patient visits you in 2 weeks?
    - Evaluate clinically and radiologically
        - Clinically - VV stress
        - Radiologically - Drop Sign
- What is the drop sign?
    - Drop sign refers to **increased in distance between trochlea and olecranon on lateral view.** Usually present immediately after index reduction but is noteworthy if persist while arm in cast or after mobilization
    - If Drop sign +ve in clinic while in back slab ➔ suggest instability ➔ Offer surgical repair OR Hinged brace for further protection
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-11 at 11.53.42 AM.png](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Screenshot_2022-06-11_at_11.53.42_AM.png)
        
    - Coonrad et al. JSES - drop sign as an assessment for instability
    - coonrad2005.pdf
- When do you need surgery?
    - No consensus on the role of surgery.
    - Consider if persistent instability/ pain
- What is the surgical strategy?
    - Based on MRI, evaluate which needs repair. commonly Common extensor origin and Common flexor Origin may be avulsed and need repair
    - LUCL first
    - Evaluate Medial side KIV separate incision to address medial collateral ligaments
- How do you assess stability after fixing LUCL and radial head?
    - In extension - Joint congruent when held in extension unsupported
    - In flexion - stable in the functional range 30-130 being stable

## Elbow Fracture dislocations

- ‼️ What are variations of Elbow fracture-dislocation?
    - **Terrible Triad** = VPLRI force = PL dislocation, Radial Head #, Coronoid # (Type 1)
    - **VPMRI** = **“isolated coronoid #”** Coronoid # (Type 2) *w/o Radial head* # + LUCL disruption (can be a/w posterior dislocation)
    - **Transolecranon** (TO) = Direct Anterior directed force = **Anterior dislocation**, Olecranon # (Basal coronoid ulnar fracture (type 3), ***PRUJ intact*** (Annular ligament intact)
    - **Monteggia Variant** (ddx to Transolecranon Fracture dislocation) = Ulnar Fracture, ***PRUJ disruption*** + Radial head fracture

    - By anatomy = O’Driscoll Classification (more helpful)
        - **Tip** = usually TT or Simple dislocation tip avulsion
        - **Anteromedial Rim** = Usually VMPRI - further divided into 3 subtypes
        - **Basal** = usually transolecranon #
    - By size = Regan Morrey
        - Tip/ < 50%/ > 50%

### Terrible Triad

![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%205.png)

- What is your definitive **management for this terrible triad**?
    - Pre Op
        - Image intensifier
        - Stand by radial head replacement, headless compression screws, hinged ex fix
    - Intra op
        - Approach - I will do a lateral approach, KIV second medial apporach if necessary
        - I will use a Trans EDC approach, taking care of the PIN by pronating the arm fully [D: Skin ➔ Subcut ➔ Go between ECU// Anconeus ➔ Pronate arm fully to bring PIN away](https://workflowy.com/#/55fc35152366)
        - Assess the Radial head
            - if comminuted > 3 ➔ Replace
            - If fixable ➔ fix with headless compression screws or plate on the arc of safety
        - I will then repair the LUCL with suture anchors
        - Assess stability ➔ unstable ➔ repair Medial ligaments via Hotchkiss over the top
        - If still unstable ➔ Hinged ex fix
    - Post Op
        - HO prophylaxis - indomethacin 75mg OM 6 weeks
- What is the arc of safety for radial implants?
    - 90deg  angle from listers tubercle to radial styloid
- Must coronoid be fixed in Terrible Triad?
    - No clear consensus
    - Some suggest that should repair anterior capsule even in type 1
    - Loukia et al. 2014 study on 14 consecutive patients w only radial head fixation and LUCL recon w/o fixation of type 1 and 2 coronoid (intraop stable on II) did not lead to instability

### **Anteromedial Facet (AMF) Coronoid Fracture aka VPMRI**

![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%206.png)

- What is VMPRI?
    - It is also known as anteriomedial facet injuries to the coronoid
    - Commonly associated with a LCL injury rather than MCL or radial head fracture
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - An untreated AMF fracture may lead to Varus posteromedial instability due to the concomittant LCL injury ➔ high risk of post traumatic arthritis
- What is the classification of Anteromedial Facet coronoid fractures?
    - Sub-classification of the O'Driscoll Classification
        - Subtype 1 = AMF only
        - Subtype 2 = AMF + rim
        - Subtype 3 = AMF + rim + sublime tubercle (attachment of medial collateral ligaments)
    
    ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%208.png)
    
- Can VPMRI injuries be treated conservatively?
    - According to systematic review by Fabian Lanzerath, very narrow indications - undisplaced type 1 and 2 with congruent joint space
- What is your surgical management for this VMPRI injury aka Anteromedial Facet Fractures?
    - Dependant on the O'driscoll subclassification
        - Type 1 = fix LUCL only with suture anchors
        - Type 2 = Buttress plating of coronoid + LUCL repair (dual incisions)
    - If still unstable ➔ check for MCL instability KIV reconstruct with suture anchors or fix the avulsion
- What is your approach to the AMF fractures?
    - If isolated **type 1** -
        - lateral approach to repair LUCL and check stability
        - Medial approach to repair MUCL
    - If **types 2 and 3**
        - Medial approach with Hotchkiss over the top to first to fix coronoid fracture
        - Lateral approach to repair LUCL
        - Return to medial to KIV fix medial ligaments

### TRANSOLECRANON Fracture-dislocation

![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%209.png)

- What is a transolecranon fracture dislocation?
    - Least frequent elbow fracture dislocation
    - **Main characteristic = collateral ligaments remain intact**
    - Disruption of ulnohumeral joint always present
    - Often mistakened as a monteggia like fracture - but can be differentiated by its intact PRUJ
- What is the outcomes expected compared to terrible triad?
    - Ironically, patients with transolecranon fracture dislocation have better results compared to terrible triad due to absence of ligament injuries
- How will you manage this Transolecranon fracture dislocation?
    - Pre op - assessment, conservative vs ORIF. ORIF to prevent secondary OA and preserve function
    - Intraop
        - Approach - **posterior global approach**, create medial flap and identify and protect ulnar nerve
        - Fix as required from posterior approach
            - 1. Address coronoid - fractured, fix with headless screws, anchors or sutures
            - 2. Address Ulna - Restore ulnar length and fix with olecranon plate
            - 3. Address Radial head - Fix KIV replace radial head via lateral flap
    - Post op
        - Back slab
        - Consider HO prophylaxis 75mg OM for 6/52

### P - Monteggia Fracture-Dislocation‼️

    - **PIN** injury is overall most common [proximity of PIN to radial head]
    - Ulnar and median nerve also reported
    - **PIN** more common in Bado type 1 and Bado type 3
    - ?ulnar nerve more common in flexion type (Type 2) (like supracon flexion type?)
- **Management** of acute Monteggia?
    - Non op - cast in supination if radial head is reduced (in **paeds**)
    - Surgical - if failure to reduce or in adults
- What are the options of surgical fixation?
    - Flexible nail if length stable fracture (paeds)

    ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2011.png)
    
- What may cause radial head to not reduce?
    - Interposition of annular ligament

![Chronic missed monteggia → Dysplastic **convex** radial head](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2012.png)

Chronic missed monteggia → Dysplastic **convex** radial head

- What are the outcomes of missed monteggia?
    - If corrected < 3 years from injury and patient age < 12 years – higher rates of success
    - If > 3 years and age > 12 years, 88% rate of radial head subluxation or OA changes
    - Nakamura et al. 2009
- ‼️ **Management** of Chronic, missed monteggia (> 4 weeks)?
    - 1. **Restore ulnar length** and alignment
        - Either single stage osteotomy
        - Gradual distraction with Ex fix
    - 2. **Open reduction** of soft tissue blocks
    - 3. Reconstruction of **Annular Ligament**
        - Triceps Fascia/ Palmaris Longus
    - 4. **Stabilization** of Radiocapitellar joint
        - Radiocapitellar K-wire

## Radial Head Fractures

- What is the management of a displaced radial head fracture?
    - Generally accepted to ORIF if presence of MECHANICAL BLOCK
    - If no mechanical block, no consensus on optimal treatment
        - Recent systematic review by Kass 2012 in JHS - insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions with similar rates of success
        - Mulders et al. JSES 2021 RCT of 45 patients - Similar functional outcomes at 1 year
        - Akesson et al. JBJS 2006 long term f/u 9 years for non op treatment - ROM slightly reduced but within functional range (F/E 30-130; 50/50 P/S)
    - 82% OA changes - but asymptomatic
- Classification for radial head fracture?
    - Mason’s
    - 1 = Non Displaced #
    - 2 = Displaced with POSSIBLE mechanical block
    - 3 = Comminuted > 3 fragments
    - 4 = a/w elbow dislocation
- What special XR views?
    - Green span view aka Coyles view
    - Angulate beam 45 degrees from forearm in neutral
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2013.png)
        
- Options for fixing radial head?
    - Goal “Achieve anatomical reduction, stable fixation, early ROM”
    - Plating ➔ safe zone arc
    - Screw ➔ Headless compression screws can be placed anywhere
- What is arc of safety? How do you know if your plate is in the arc of safety?
    - Radial head articulates with the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna.
    - Arc of safety is the arc of the radial head which does not articulate here
    - 2 ways to know:
        1. Clinically - 90 ° arc from radial styloid to lister’s tubercle
        2. Radiologically - directly opposite bicipital tuberosity
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-06-11 at 10.59.06 AM.png](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Screenshot_2022-06-11_at_10.59.06_AM.png)
            
- ‼️ When will you replace the radial head?
    - David **Ring et al. JBJS 2002**
        - Study of 56 patients with ORIF
        - > 3 fragments had unsatisfactory result.
    - Purpose is to “use as a spacer while ligaments heal!”, "Provide longitudinal stability"; Radial head is secondary varus stabilizer.
- What to look out for in radial head replacement?
    - Avoid overstuffing - 2 ways to evaluate
        - **Athwal et al. 2010** recommend direct visualization of lateral ulnohumeral joint gap to determine size,
        - Assessed with fluoroscopy - most medial and most lateral ulnohumeral joint is the same with elbow in valgus
    - Uncemented vs Cemented = no difference
    - Monobloc vs Bipolar– bipolar higher revision rates. So use monobloc

### Essex Lopresti Injury

- ‼️ What associated injuries must you rule out in radial head fractures?
    - Essex Lopresti Injury! - Rare
    - This is the upper limb equivalent of a Maisonneuve fracture
    - MOI: axial compressive load to the forearm with the elbow in an extended position, either from a fall or from high-energy trauma
        - "Though radial head fracture has been thought to be the primary event of the ELI, high-speed video data from simulated axial load injuries in cadavers indicate that the injury may be initiated by transverse radioulnar displacement with IOM disruption, followed by fracture of the radial head."
            - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959902](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959902/)
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2014.png)
        
- What is the management of an **acute** Essex Lopresti injury?
    - 1. Radial head ORIF or replacement
    - 2. Immobilization of DRUJ in supination with wires of screws

    - 5 bands/ cords described, most important being the central band
    
    ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2015.png)
    
- How do you reconstruct the interoseeous membrane?
    - Pronator teres as a graft
    - It is d**etached proximally from the humerus**, rotated and inserted distally to the ulna to reconstruct the central band
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- What is the management of a chronic Essex Lopresti injury?
    - 1. Ulnar **shortening** osteotomy
        - need to do this first as will not be possible to pull soft tissue on shortened radius back up to length
    - 2. **Reconstruction** of IOM with pronator teres
    - 3. **Radial head replacement** or excision
    - 4. Manage distal **TFCC** injury

## Galeazzi Injury

- What is galeazzi fracture?
    - Complex DRUJ disruption with an unstable radius fracture, commonly at the junction between the middle and distal thirds of the radial shaft
    - Highly unstable - "fracture of necessity"
- ‼️ What are predictors of DRUJ involvement pre op?
    - **Rettig Classification** based on location of fracture from fistal radius
    - < 7.5cm = unstable (>50% unstable)
    - > 7.5cm = likely stable (<10% unstable)
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2017.png)
        
- Management of Galeazzi Fractures?
    - 3 potential outcomes after fixing radius
        - 1. DRUJ stable ➔ no intervention
        - 2. DRUJ stable in one direction (P or S) ➔ splint in that position for 4-6 weeks
        - 3. DRUJ unstable in all directions ➔ Cast in supination for 6 weeks OR Acute TFCC repair OR fix ulnar styloid fracture if present OR transfix
            
            ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2018.png)
            
- What may block reduction after fixing radius? What approach to release?
    - Most common soft tissue interpositon is **ECU** and **EDQ** (Extensor digiti qiunti)
    - Dorsal approach to release - just lateral to ulnar prominence

    - **Medial** column - distal **ulna**, TFCC
    - **Intermediate** column - **lunate fossa**, medial part of distal radius,
        - This is the primary weight beaing column
    - **Lateral** column - **scaphoid fossa** and styloid process
        - Need to restore this column to re-establish length and alignment of articular surface
- ‼️ What are the prognostic features of stability? Whether the fracture will be maintained?
    - La-Fontaine's Criteria - **5 criteria**
    - Age > **60**, dorsal comminution, dorsal angulation, intra-articular fracture, ulnar fracture
    - if **3 or more** = unstable!
    - More recent Mackenney 2006 Found predictors of stability are: Age >80, Comminution and positive ulnar variance (i.e. radial collapse)
- ‼️ How do you do a Bier's Block? How do you monitor? How do you safeguard for lidocaine toxicity? (#❗️ )
    - First, I will set another IV plug on other arm in case resuscitation is required, ensure crash cart near by.
    - Tourniquet placed on arm
    - Cuff inflated to 100mmHg above patient's SBP
    - LA (an amide) injected - Dose?
        - Dose = **3mg/kg.**
        - Dilute **1%** with equal amount of normal saline to make 0.5% solution.
    - Cuff should be inflated for **MINIMUM 20-25min** post injection, **MAXIMUM 60-90min**
    - I will **deflate briefly for 10 s, then reinflate**. If no signs of toxicity after 45s, then deflate again fro 5-10 sec. Repeat once more prior to permanently removing it
    - Monitor for toxicity - headache, dizziness, CVS collapse, seizures.
- If there is a concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome, how will you make your incision?
    - I will make separate incisions i.e. henry’s approach to forearm and separate carpal tunnel incision
    - This is ro prevent injury to the Palmar cutaneous branch of median nerve.

### ELDERLY, LOW FUNCTION

- ‼️ How will you manage this fracture in elderly low function?
    - P and I
    - P - elderly, low function
    - I - it is unstable, and will likely go into malunion and OA
    - I will guide my treatment based on the 2013 AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines.

    - For low function elderly **> 65**, Studies consistently no difference in patient reported outcomes despite improvements in radiographic parameters
    - Arora 2011 JBJS published a RCT of 73 patients comparing ORIF vs cast for > 65 yo for displaced, unstable DR fractures. At 12 months, no difference in ROM, pain and DASH scores. Achieving anatomical reconstruction did not convey any improvements in ROM or ability of ADL.

    - I would offer her a correction osteotomy of the distal radius using a volar locking plate through an extended flexor carpi radialis (FCR) approach.
- Cx: Patient comes back with inability to extend thumb. What has happened?
    - Rupture of EPL at the level of Lister's tubercle
    - Occurs in 1%
- How do you clinically assess EPL tendon?
    - Retropulsion test
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2025.png)
        
    - Do not test with extension of IPJ as the EPB tendon inserts into the thumb at varying levels
- Investigation?
    - US to confirm rupture
- How do you check the presence of EIP tendon for reconstruction?
    - EDC has common muscle belly between the 4 fingers, so you have to defunction the EDC by flexing 2 and 3rd fingers
    - EIP **lies ulnar** to EDC tendon

- How do you **manage** the ruptured EPL/ FPL tendon in setting of Distal Radius Fracture?
    - **3 options - tendon graft, transfer or Fusion.** Depends on the **chronicity** of rupture, **function** of patient, **quality** of tendon
    - Quality is usually poor for end to end repair due to **attritional nature** of injury
    - Chronicity - if acute, muscle FPL or EPL muscle bulk will be intact. If chronic, muscle may be atrophied
        - If Acute, muscle bulk intact ➔ Consider **Tendon grafting** from *PL tendon* or a *strip of FCR* tendon, connecting using tendon weave technique (e.g. Pulvertaft weave)
        - If Chronic, no muscle bulk ➔ consider **Tendon transfer**
            - EPL ➔ use **EIP**
            - FPL rupture ➔ use **FDS 3/4**
    - If low demand patient ➔ **Fusion** to provide stable base
- How do you do a **EIP to EPL transfer**?
    - 3 incisions needed
        - 1. **1cm transverse incision** dorsal to index finger MC head to harvest EIP
        - 2. **3cm midline dorsal incision** proximal to wrist to bring EIP tendon proximal to extensor retinaculum
        - 3. Incision over Thumb Metacarpal to identify EPL tendon distal stump

        - 
- ‼️ What are the principles of tendon transfer?
    - Total **9 S**
    - **Joint** - no joint contractures (**S**upple joint)
    - **Bed** - no infection (a**S**eptic bed)
    - **Donor** - 8S - **S**trong donor (grade 4 or 5 as it will drop one grade), **S**acrificable Donor, **S**ufficient length/ amplitude (Smith's 3-5-7 rule), **S**ynergistic (fire in concert with paralyzed muscles), **S**traight line Pull, **S**ingle tendon for single function.
    - **Patient -** good compliance to PT (**S**uitable Patient)
    - *Smith 3-5-7* = 3cm for wrist flexor and extensor, Finger extensors 5cm, finger flexors 7cm
- Cx: patient comes back with inability to flex thumb. What has happened?

    - FPL tendon attritional rupture
- Investigation?
    - US to confirm rupture is at the plate
- Why not use PL transfer?
    - It is a weaker muscle and unable to power FPL

### SCENARIO: YOUNG OR ELDERLY BUT HIGH FUNCTION

- How will you manage this fracture?
    - P and I
    - P - elderly, but high function, dominant arm
    - I - unstable,
    - Offer surgery to allow early ROM, reduce malunion, reduce secondary OA
    - Goal - restore the three columns of the distal radius based on the Rikli and Regazonni 3 column theory by obtaining anatomic reducion of the joint surface consisting of the scaphoid and lunate fossas
- Surgical reduction tips? Any Special XR views?
    - Release Brachioradialis to help with reduction
    - Temparory K-wires
    - Special XR views to assess screw breach?
        - **Skyline** views for **dorsal** penetration to prevent extensor tendon attrition -
            - wrist in palmar flexion with beam angulating at the axis of the radius
            
            ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2031.png)
            
        - **22 ° elevated lateral view** to assess **intra-articular** screw penetration
            - Beam directed laterally with forearm angulated 23 degree above table
            
            ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2032.png)
            
- Dorsal vs Volar Plating?
    - Most concerning is that of volar collapse. Higher risk of volar collapse in dorsal plating
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2033.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2034.png)
        
    - Dorsal plate (-) **Tendon ruptures** most common Extensor indices tendon most commonly ruptures, ECRB most commonly attritioned, EPL usually not affected as it is already released.
- Do you need to fix all unla styoid fractures?
    - Concern of Ulnar styloid fracture is attachment of TFCC and corresponding DRUJ instability
    - No clear consensus in management.
        - If **stable** after DR fix ➔ no need fix Ulnar styloid
        - If **unstable** after DR fix ➔ fix Ulnar styloid BUT will consider supination splinting if it keeps DRUJ reduced.

- What do you know about Volar plating vs K-wire fixation?
    - DRAFTT (Distal Radius Acute Fracture Fixation Trial) Trial in the BMJ 2014. **RCT** comparing K-wires vs volar plate with dorsally displaced DR fracture. **461** patients, Multicenter over 18 trauma centers. Found no difference in functional outcomes between K-wire and plate.
        - 461 patients, > 18 years old, fracture < 2 weeks old.
        - Patients were excluded if the fracture extended > 3 cm from the radiocarpal joint, if the fracture was open (with a Gustilo grading greater than 1), if the articular surface of the radiocarpal joint could not be reduced by indirect techniques (in some fractures, the joint surface is so badly disrupted that the surgeon will have to open up the fracture in order to restore the anatomy under direct vision)
        - Found **no difference in function, complications, cost-saving intervention**
        - "This large multicentre trial contradicts both the rapidly increasing use of locking plates in the treatment of distal radius fractures and the conclusions from previous trials that suggested that locking plates provide improved functional outcomes, particularly in the early stages of rehabilitation. The previous trials were smaller single centre studies."

- What are specific complications that you know about? How to prevent it?
    - **CRPS** – Based on AAOS CPG (moderate) and RCT by Zollinger et al. 2007, incidence of CRPS 10% in placebo, 2% in vitamin C
    - Zollinger - RCT 416 patients randomized to placebo/ 200/ 500/ 1500mg of vitamin C daily. Placebo group 10% vs Vitamin C group 2.4%. Reccomended dose is **500mg OM x 50 days**
    - Dose = **500mg OM x 50 days**
    - Also, avoid tight casts, painful manipulations

### Post-traumatic RadioUlnar Synostosis

- What are the risk factors of radioulnar synostosis?
    - Trauma-related: **monteggia**, fracture of both forearm bones at the **same level**, **open** fracture,significant **soft-tissue** lesion, **comminutive** fracture, **high-energy** kinetic fracture, associated **cranial trauma,** or bone fragments on the **interosseous membrane**
    - Treatment-related: excessive trauma-to-surgery inter-val, **single** (Boyd) approach for synthesis of both forearmbones, **cortical screws too long** (extending beyond the second cortex), primary bone graft, **prolonged immo-bilization** or delayed rehabilitation.
- How to prevent?
    - **Dual incision** approach
    - Meticulous soft tissue handling
    - Not excessively long screws
    - Early rehab with PROM
- How to classify synostosis?
    - By location
    - Type 1 = distal
    - Type 2 = middle
    - Type 3 = proximal
        
        ![Untitled](Radius%20Ulna%20Fractures%20-%20Elbow%20#%20dislocations%20Forea%20b5e3f92b869a417d8ca9d18af2f9f29a/Untitled%2036.png)
        
- Investigation?
    - CT scan to evaluate position
- When to operate?
    - No consensus on optimal time. Recommended duration ranges from 6 months to 2 years post op.
    - I will do serial XR and monitor for progression till stabilized before intervention
- Surgical technique?
    - Excision of synostosis
    - KIV **Interposition** (unsure benefit of interposition)
    - Options for interposition - anconeus muscle, fascia lata autograft
- Adjuvant therapies?
    - No present consensus
    - Bisphosphonates proved effective for HO but no study done on preventing synostosis recurrence
    - Radiotherapy has been described
