- What is the difference in cervical radiculopathy vs lumbar radiculopathy?
    - There is pedicle/ nerve root mismatch. Cervical spine root is above the Vertebrae. Also, nerve root anatomy is more horizontal in cervical spine ‚ûî so central and foraminal disc will affect the same nerve root
    - In lumbar spine, e.g. L4/L5 disc, central disc will affect traversing root L5, and far lateral disc will affect exiting root L4
    - In cervical spine, C4/C5 disc will affect C5 exiting root
    - C7/T1 will affect C8.

- What is the natural history of cervical myelopathy?
    - Natural history Robinson and Clarke Paper 1956
        - 75% Stepwise progression
        - 20% slow gradual progression
        - 5% rapid deterioration
- What are the causes of Cervical myelopathy?
    - **Anterior** structures - kyphosis, disc herniation, syndesmophytes, OPLL
    - **Posterior** structures - Ligamentum flavum Hypertrophy, Ossified yellow ligament, Facet joint hypertrophy
    - **Spondylolisthesis**
    - **Trauma/ Infection/ Tumor**
    - Also consider non ortho - transverse myelitis
- What are key PE findings?
    - 3 UL ‚Äì Hoffmann, Finger escape, Grip release [20 in 10sec]
    - 2 LL ‚Äì Romberg, Tandem gait
- What is basis of Romberg test?
    - Proprioception is carried by the Dorsal columns ‚ûî compressed ‚ûî reduced proprioception
    - Balance requires 3 sensory inputs = visual, vestibular, prioception
    - When close eyes, left with 2 - vestibular and proprioception and normally patient can balance
    - When proprioception is not present, patient will have positive Romberg's
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What if you find that upper limb symptoms are not matching?
    - Double crush syndrome
    - Such patients may have double crush syndrome (DCS) with compression of nerve fibers at 2 distinct sites: 1 proximal in the C-spine, and 1 distal in the cubital tunnel, carpal tunnel, or elsewhere
    - I will order **NCS/ EMG**
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è How do you classify severity in cervical myelopathy?
    - mJOA score - based on **UL, LL, Sensory and Urinary symptoms** out of 18!
    - THe lower the score, the more severe.
    - < 11 = severe, Moderate 12-14, Mild > 15

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What are you looking for on the XR in cervical myelopathy?
    - "looking for **4 factors** that will **influence my surgical approach and technique**" = alignment, presence of instabiliity, number of levels and presence of OPLL.
        - **K-line** Mid point of canal at C2 and canal at C7 - lordosis or kyphosis [Positive means lordosis]
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Degeneration%20476a284ef3fa4afa856d29eb9cdd4903/Untitled%202.png)
        
        - **Number** of levels involved
        - Presence of **OPLL**? - posterior approach due to risk of dural leak
        - Presence of POSSIBLE **Instability** - listhesis confirm with flex extension views
- What other invx?
    - Flex extension views - instability is present if change in translation **> 3.5mm, angulation > 11**
    - MRI C-spine - myelomalaciae
- What is the difference between cord edema and myelomalacia?
    - **Myelomalacia** = associated with **focal cord atrophy; softening** of the cord
        - Myelomalacia appears **hypointense** to the cord (but hyperintense than CSF) on T1WI, and **hyperintense** to the cord (can be similar to CSF) on T2WI
    - **Cord Edema** - no atrophy but swelling around cord due to inflammation

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What are parameters to assess canal space/ stenosis?
    - Torg pavlov ratio - for each segment
        - It is sagittal canal diameter divided by the vertebral body diameter
        - <0.8 is abnormal = cervical canal stenosis
            
            ![Untitled](Cervical%20Degeneration%20476a284ef3fa4afa856d29eb9cdd4903/Untitled%203.png)
            
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è How will you manage this patient with cervical myelopathy?
    - Based on AO Spine Clinical Practice Guidelines 2017 by Fehlings et al.; based on mJOA score
    - **Mild** = Conservative or Op if not responding
    - **Mod/ severe** = Op
    - **Non myelopathic but with MRI cord compression**
        - If radiculopathy = Op or close f/u
        - If no radiculopathy = conservative
- How to choose between Anterior and posterior approach?
    - **Anterior** (fusion vs ADR)
        - compression is anterior (except OPLL)
        - compression at 2 or fewer segments,
        - Kyohosis
    - **Posterior** (laminoplasty vs laminectomy and fusion)
        - multilevels
        - lordotic alignment
        - OPLL [floatback effect]
        - Compression from back e.g. OYLL
    - **When to fuse?**
        - Axial neck pain? = fuse
        - Instability = fuse
    - Combined - kyphosis with more than 2 levels (Combined ACCF + posterior fusion)

### OPLL (Ossified Posterior Longitudinal Ligament)

- How do you classify?
    - Mizuno Classifx - localised, segmented, continuous, mixed
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Degeneration%20476a284ef3fa4afa856d29eb9cdd4903/Untitled%204.png)
        
- How does presence of OPLL influence management?
    - Risk of dural injury which I can further quanity with CT scan looking at single layer or double layer signs
    - Sway towards Posterior approach to prevent dural leak if max occupational ratio < 60% and K-line lordosis.
- How do you evaluate OPLL? Impact on management?
    - **Maximum Occupancy ratio** = size of OPLL / Spinal canal
        - if it is > 60%, posterior procedures likely will not work due to extensive anterior component ‚ûî will need to risk anterior approach

    - CT scan - evaluate **C-signs**
        - C sign indicates that the lateral dura had become imbricated in the OPLL mass
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-25 at 9.19.59 PM.png](Cervical%20Degeneration%20476a284ef3fa4afa856d29eb9cdd4903/Screenshot_2022-06-25_at_9.19.59_PM.png)
        
- Does OPLL continue to progress after laminoplasty?
    - Yes. Younger age and mixed- or continuous-type OPLL are associated with increased risk of OPLL progression.
    - Fortunately, despite relatively high rates of progression in OPLL, there is a low rate of late neurological deterioration among patients managed both nonoperatively and operatively
    - Why neurological function is preserved after laminoplasty in some patients despite radiographic evidence of OPLL growth has yet to be answered definitively.
    - OPLL Common after Laminoplasty.pdf

### ANTERIOR PROCEDURES

- What are the 3 fascial layers in the neck?
    - Deep cervical fascia
    - Pretracheal fascia
    - Prevertebral fascia
    
    ![Untitled](Cervical%20Degeneration%20476a284ef3fa4afa856d29eb9cdd4903/Untitled%205.png)
    
- Anatomy of RLN? Evidence for right vs left regarding RLN?
    - RLN
        - Vagus nerves travels in the carotid sheath
        - Left RLN branches off at the **arch** of aorta
        - Right RLN branches off at the **subclavian** artery
        - **left** arises goes under arch of aorta; **right** hooks around subclavian artery
        - Goes within the tracheo-esophageal groove ‚ûî gentle retraction
    - Supply -¬†supplies **all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx**, with the exception of the cricothyroid muscles
        
        ![Untitled](Cervical%20Degeneration%20476a284ef3fa4afa856d29eb9cdd4903/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - **No difference in injury rates** thought LEFT is more consistent
    - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919117300766](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919117300766)
- What if preop voice hoarsness - what further invx?
    - Refer ENT for laryngoscopy to check vocal cord function
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Evidence for ADR vs ACDF?
    - Theoretically motion preserving ‚ûî thoretically lower risk of ASD
    - but will not choose for patients with axial neck pain or instability
    - However, conflicting data on Adjacent segment disease
        - **Systematic review JBJS 2018 Findlay** et al. 14 RCT, 3160 patients ‚ûî Similar outcomes. BUT ADR reduces risk of ASD both short and long term. (controversial, some papers say same)
- Multi level CSM: 3 level ACDF (6 surfaces) OR 2 level ACCF?
    - Controversial which is better:
    - **ACCF Pros** = minimizes the number of graft-host interfaces, allows more extensive decompression, and provides a source for bony autograft to promote fusion
    - **ACCF Cons** = potential for graft extrusion due to the fewer possible points for ventral plate screw fixation
    - **ACDF Pros** = lower risk of graft extrusion
    - **ACDF Cons** = incomplete decompression behind vertebral body, higher risk of pseudoarthrosis
    - Study show similar postoperative alignment, ASD, Pseudoarthrosis, pain relief. ACCF has higher estimated blood loss.

- What are the risks and complications of spinal anterior surgery?
    - Early vs Late
    - Early
        - Number 1 = dysphagia!
        - RLN injury -Constant hoarseness,
        - Seroma/ Hematoma formation
        - Wound healing/ infection
        - Vertebral artery injury
    - Late
        - **Adjacent segment disease (ASD)**
            - Hilibrand et al. 10 year follow up - annual incidence 2.9%, 5 year 11.7%, **10 year 25%** for  SYMPTOMATIC ASD
                - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10225797/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10225797/)
            - Risk factors for ASD - single level fusion involving the 5th or 6th vertebrae; pre-existing radiographic evidence of degeneration
                - ‚ûî more than 2/3 in whom ASD develop fail Non op.
                - ‚ûî paper proposes that all degenerative segments should be included in cervical fusion
            - **ADR vs ACDF - no diference at 10 years.**
        - **Pseudoarthrosis**
            - Definition of pseudoarthrosis? (3)
                - 1. persistent or worsening axial pain 6/12 after index procedure
                - 2. Radiolucency at host graft interface
                - 3. Vertebral motion > 2mm or 4 ¬∞ on flex extension
            - usually occurs at caudal level (bottom)
            - Mx = may remain asymptomatic. So only treat symptomatic pseudoarthrosis
            - Risk factors? = number of levels of fusion, use of plate
                - 1 level - ACDF + plate is better than no plate (97% vs 92%)
                - 2 level - ACDF = Corpectomy (similar rates of fusion 95%)
                - 3 level - Corpectomy is better (95% vs 90%)
            
            ![Untitled](Cervical%20Degeneration%20476a284ef3fa4afa856d29eb9cdd4903/Untitled%207.png)
            
        - Stiffness!
- What is the most common complication for ACDF?
    - Dysphagia
- ‚ÄúPatient is post op 2 weeks, how will you evaluate him?‚Äù
    - C5 palsy
    - Horner‚Äôs syndrome
    - Dysphagia, Dysphonia
- Risk factors for dysphagia?
    - Multilevel, long surgery, elderly, high cervical surgery (C3/C4)
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è How to reduce dysphagia after ACDF?
    - IV Steroids
    - Paper by **Jenkins et al. RCT** of 75 patients undergoing ACDF randomized to 3 groups - No steroids, IV steroid, Local steroid. Both steroid groups had significant reduced dysphagia rates compared to control [group.at](http://group.at) 2 week, 6 week, 3 months and 1 year.

- Anterior **revision op** - any further other preop investigation?
    - Refer ENT because could have asymptomatic damage to unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side of the previous approach
    - If nerve is damaged then will use the same approach and be careful of contralateral side.

### POSTERIOR PROCEDURES

- What is the principle of posterior approaches?
    - ‚Äúindirect‚Äù decompression via float back of spinal cord
- Cervical Spine Posterior Approach
    - P ‚Äì prone with Mayfield clamps (3 prongs),
        - Pins tightened to **60lbs**
        - **Preparation** - shave hair, tape down shoulders, ensure pressure points well padded - knee, ankles, iliac crests
    - Pre op Localisation
    - I ‚Äì longitudinal midline
    - D ‚Äì Incise down through fascia and **Nuchal** ligament ‚ûî Cobb elevator to Elevate cervical muscles ‚ûî expose to facet joints and beginnings of transverse processes ‚ûî identify ligamentum flavum and release from **leading edge at inferior vertebrae**  ‚ûî perform superior lamina laminectomy as necessary to see the dura
- What is laminoplasty?
    - Open door vs French door; more familiar with open door
    - Open door = Hirayabashi technique
        - Hinge created at junction of lateral mass and lamina
        - Held opened by plates
    - French Door = Kurokawa
    - + : Motion Preserving
    - C5 palsy
- What is laminectomy and fusion
    - Technique - lateral mass screw vs pedicle screw
- Will you do isolated Laminectomy without fusion?
    - Rarely indicated due to risk of post laminectomy kyphosis
- Post op C5 Palsy?
    - Controversial mechanism of injury
    - In laminectomy, thought to be due to tethering of nerve root with dorsal migration of spinal Cord, resulting in stretching of the C5 nerve root
    - HOWEVER, incidence found to be no difference in anterior or posterior surgeries. Incidence ~4.6%
