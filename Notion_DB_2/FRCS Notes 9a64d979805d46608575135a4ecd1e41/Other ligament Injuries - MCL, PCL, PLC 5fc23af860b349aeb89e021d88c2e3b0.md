## MCL Injuries

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Mx Goal** = stable functional knee
**Mx Options** = Non op vs op depending on function and symptoms and disease factors (stener lesion)

</aside>

- What is the pellegrini-stieda lesion?
    - Calcifications at or near the medial collateral ligament femoral attachment
    - Suggestion of chronic MCL injury

        - Pellegrini Steida lesion [What is the pellegrini-stieda lesion?](https://workflowy.com/#/fb8a6a68e1a7)
- Attachment of the superficial MCL?
    - Femur - just proximal and posterior to medial epicondyle
    - Tibia - 6 cm below joint line (surprising low down) with a length of 11cm! (broad attachment)
    
    ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%201.png)
    
- Which side does the MCL gets avulsed off more frequently?
    - **Femoral** side
    - Tibia side injuries are less common but is a relative surgical indication
- How do you assess the MCL?
    - Assess in flexion and extension.
    - In extension, **posteromedial capsule** contributes to stability and thus lead to false negative
- How do you classify Clinically?
    - Grades 1-3
    - 1 = incomplete tears < 5mm opening
    - 2 = 5-10mm opening
    - Grade 3 = > 10mm opening with no firm end point
- What investigation? What you looking for?
    - MRI scan
    - Looking for which side is the tear - femur or tibia
    - **Wave sign** = suggests a tibia sided avulsion, not seen in femur avulsions (Taketomi et al.)
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - if tibia, is it bunched up and above the pes anserinus tendon âž” **stener** lesion
- What classification for TIBIA sided tears diagnosed on MRI?
    - Taketomi et al.
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Type 1 = under pes anserinus (good)
    - Type 2 = **Stener** like lesion
    - Type 3 = **interposed** in medial joint
    
    [taketomi2014.pdf](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/taketomi2014.pdf)
    
- What are the relative indications for surgery?
    - 1. **Stener-like lesion** (Taketomi type 2)(interposed by Pes Anserinus) - this must be a tibia sided tear (which is rare)
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - 2. Interposed **in joint** (Taketomi type 3)
    - 3. **Displaced**, bony avulsions
- Surgical options?
    - Stener lesion - can repair with suture anchors if done early and not yet contracted
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%205.png)

    - Single bundle vs double bundle non anatomical (1 femoral attachment), double bundle anatomical (2 femoral attachment) - basically to fix sMCL KIV POL

## MCL with ACL TEARS

- What classification?
    - Nakamura Classification
    - Type 1 = Femoral sided tear
    - Type 2 = Tibia sided tear (none in his study)
    - Type 3 = Femoral sided tear with extension below the joint line
- Management of the MCL in concomittant ACL tears?
    - Classically MCL is treated conservatively in a brace for 6/52 before ACL recon. If still lax then âž” can consider concomitant reconstruction
        - Shelbourne et al. 1992 in his series of 84 patients good to excellent outcomes with non op for MCL and op for ACL. Concomitant recon lead to higher incidence of stiffness.
        
        [shelbourne1992.pdf](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/shelbourne1992.pdf)
        
    - Nevertheless, consider surgery if Nakamura Type 3 or type 2Tibia sided stener lesions
    - In Nakamura paper, type 1 90% regained stability with non op of MCL while for type 3 (diffuse tear) non regained stability. âž” Reccomend surgery

## PCL Injuries

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Mx Goal** = stable functional knee
**Mx Options** = Non op vs op depending on function and symptoms
**Surgical Considerations** = technique (onlay vs tunnel, SB vs DB),  visualization (PM portal), Post op rehab

</aside>

- What associated injury and incidence?
    - > 50% of PCL injuries a/w PLC injury
- What 3 clinical tests?
    - Tibial step off sign
    - Posterior drawer test
    - Quadriceps active drawer test - ask patient to contract quads with foot fixed to bed
    - Need to do PLC tests!
- What are the 2 surgical techniques?
    - **TIbia in-lay** technique
        - Involves screw with **bone block** over posterior aspect of tibia
            
            ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%206.png)
            
        - Incision = Posteromedial approach between SemiM//medial gastroc
        - **Adv**: avoid killer turn theoretically less graft attrition
    - **Tunnel** technique
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%207.png)
        
- Which technique better?
    - No consensus on which technique is better.
    - [Shin et al. 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11999-016-5176-6) CORR systematic review
- Single bundle vs double bundle?
    - SB only constructs the ALB while DB constructs both ALB and PMB
    - No consensus which is better. [Chahla et al. Arthroscopy 2017 Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28866340/) found DB objectively better stability but no difference in outcomes for DB vs SB reconstruction
    - [Nature SB vs DB Migliorini](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07976-w) et al. No difference
- Management for ISOLATED PCL tear?
    - Conservative in Jack's brace = brace with anterior translation force; expecting good outcomes.
    - JBJS 2017 paper found 90% return to high level sports in 2 years
- Outcomes for non operative treatment?
    - [Agolley et al. JBJS 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28566396/) 46 patients with MRI PCL torn, grade 2 and 3. RTS at 10 weeks, full competition at 16 wk. 90% at higher level sport at 2 years. 69% same sport at 5 years
        - Protocol = 2 week Jack brace PWB âž” PWBAT with PROM and closed chain exercises (avoid exercises that translate tibia posteriorly âž” Open chain exercises after 6 weeks with FWBAT
    - [Akisue et al. Arthroscopy 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12072759/) also found in follow up MRI that 75% patients of PCL develop a slack but continuous ligament like tissue which contributes to stability and improvement in posterior drawer tests

## PLC Injuries

- What is the Posterolateral Corner?
    - 3 main structures = LCL, Popliteofibular Ligament, Popliteus tendon; the rest are secondary
        
        ![Untitled](Key%20Anatomy%201ca9aa78a6a540d1afa466dffac46c1b/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - PLC consists of both dynamic and static stablizers
        - **Static (4 ligaments)** = LCL, popliteofibular ligament, flabellofibular ligament, arcuate ligament
        - **Dynamic (3)** = Popliteus, biceps femoris and lateral head of gastroc
    - + posterolateral capsule
    
    ![Untitled](Key%20Anatomy%201ca9aa78a6a540d1afa466dffac46c1b/Untitled%202.png)
    
- Clinical tests for PLC?
    - Dial test
        - Place patient prone, ER feet at 30 and 90 degrees.
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%208.png)
        
        - > 10Â° external rotation asymmetry at **30Â°** only consistent with isolated PLC injury
        - > 10Â° external rotation asymmetry at **30Â°and 90Â°** consistent with PLC and PCL injury
    - Recurvatum test
- Classifx of PLC?
    - Modified Houghston Classifx by degree of varus and dial test instability
    - Grade 1 = Varus <5mm opening, Dial test 5 deg
    - Grade 2 = Varus 5-10mm opening, Dial test 6-10 deg
    - Grade 3 = Varus > 10mm, dial test > 10 Â°
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%209.png)
        
- Management for High grade Grade 3? Options of recon?
    - Non -anatomic Recon = **Larson (1 femur tunnel)**
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%2010.png)
        
        - Recon **LCL and PFL** only
        - Tunnel through fibula with loop of graft
        - Tunnel through femur with interference screw
    - Anatomic Recon = Laprade (2 femur tunnels)
        
        ![Untitled](Other%20ligament%20Injuries%20-%20MCL,%20PCL,%20PLC%205fc23af860b349aeb89e021d88c2e3b0/Untitled%2011.png)
        
        - Recon LCL, PFL **and Popliteus Tendon**
        - LCL recon with femur and fibula tunnel with interference screw
        - PFL recon is continuation of LCL graft into posterior tibia and pulled through anteriorly
        - Popliteus tendon recon is from femur tunnel through the posterior tibia to anterior
