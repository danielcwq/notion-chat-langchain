Topic: Hip

- What is the most common bacteria?
    - Most common is Staph Aureus
    - Second is Polymicrobial
    - Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS)
- How will you investigate?
    - I will investigate with biochemical and radiological, aspiration tests guided by the MSIS criteria
    - **Bloods** (2) - TW, CRP , ESR
    - **XR** - Loosening, lytic lesions
    - **Aspirate** (4) - Alpha defensin, PMN % , cell count
- What advanced imaging (if forced to say)?
    - Radionuclide studies
    - Technetium 99m bone scan + WBC scan is the most specific scanning method

- ‼️ What is the MSIS criteria?
    - 2 + (2+4) + 4

- What are the cut off values for the tests?
    - Based on the International Consensus Meeting 2013
    - **Acute**: CRP > **100**, ESR NAD, Synovial count > **10k**, PMN > **90%**
    - **Chronic**: CRP > **10**, ESR >**30**, Synovial count **3k**, PMN > **80**% [chronic lower]
    - Synovial CRP **> 6.9**
    - D-dimer 860

- What is Alpha defensin?
    - Enzyme produced by neutrophils in response to infection
    - 96.9% accurate

- ‼️ What is Biofilm?
    - It is a complex aggregation of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each other in a **Glycocalyx**
- How does the biofilm benefit the bacteria?
    - 1. It makes bacteria 1000-1500x more resistant to antibiotics
    - 2. Scavenging system that traps minerals and nuetrients
- What are the stages of Biofilm formation?
    - 1. Reversible docking (4/52) - via van der waals forces
    - 2. Irreversible docking - cell adhesion via pili
    - 3. Maturation - forms columns, mushrooms and streamer shape
    - 4. Dispersion - spreading and colonizing new surfaces
    - All this done via **"qourum sensing"** by which bacteria signal one another to wake up and grow via signaling molecules
- How do you classify PJI?
    - **Tsukayama** Classification by chronicity and mechanism
    - 1. Postive intra-Op Cultures only
    - 2. Early post operative infection (within 4 week of op)
    - 3. Late Acute hematogenous (after asymptomatic period but < 4 week symptoms)
    - 4. Late Chronic infection (> 4 week, has features of chronicity - sinus, abscess, local edema)
        
        ![Untitled](Prosthetic%20Joint%20infection%20767b0fc7f4584730bb7c022aceb7379f/Untitled%203.png)
        
- Acute management of PJI?
    - Withhold abx if patient stable
    - Aspiration in OT under aseptic technique

## DEFINITIVE MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS

- What if **MSIS + and < 3 weeks**?
    - This is an acute infection within 3 weeks
    - We have option for the **DAIR** (debridement, antibiotics and implant retention) procedure assuming we meet the other criteria such as stable implant intraop, Non virulent bacteria with available antibiotic treatment and no sinus tracks
    - According to Sendi et al. in 2017 (on infected THR), if the patient meets the 4 crtieria, then 90% success rate
    
    [sendi2017.pdf](Prosthetic%20Joint%20infection%20767b0fc7f4584730bb7c022aceb7379f/sendi2017.pdf)
    
- What are the Pre-requisites for DAIR procedure?
    - CPG by ID society of America 2013 - 4 criterias
        1. < 3 weeks of symptoms to prevent biofilm formation OR within 30 days of prosthesis implantation
        2. Stable implant
        3. Pathogen susceptible to Antibiotics
        4. No sinus track or abscess
- What do you do in DAIR procedure?
    - Complete synovectomy, exchange of liner, drain insertion
    - Send off odd number of cultures

- Any scores to predict DAIR failure?
    - KLIC score
    - Bascially prognisticating factors of failure are CRF, Liver cirrhosis, High CRP (infective load), Previous revision surgery or cemented implant.
    - Score of maximum 9.5
    - High risk > 7 points - failure rate of 60%
    - Low risk < 2 points - failure rate of 33%
        
        ![Untitled](Prosthetic%20Joint%20infection%20767b0fc7f4584730bb7c022aceb7379f/Untitled%204.png)
        
- Repeat DAIR success rates?
    - Repeat DAIR has lower success rates
    - Toh Rui Xiang et al. Repeat DAIRs, elevated ESR > 107.5, and S aureus PJI are associated with treatment failure and 2-stage revision is recommended.
    
    [Debridement, Antibiotics, and Implant Retention in Periprosthetic Joint Infection: What Predicts Success or Failure? - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34116912/)
    
- Does the use of cemented implants increase the risk of PJI?
    - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6571822/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6571822/)
    - In pooled analyses of observational studies, all cemented fixations were associated with an increased overall PJI risk when compared with uncemented fixations,
        - However,
    - However, in the first six months, uncemented fixations were associated with increased PJI risk when compared to all cemented fixations.
    - Compared to antibiotic-loaded cemented fixations, **plain cemented fixations were associated with an increased PJI risk**
    - **summary:** First 6 months, uncemented higher risk. Overall, cemented higher risk. Plain cement higher risk than antibiotic loaded cement.
- What if **MSIS + and > 3 weeks**?
    - I will do a two stage revision
    - **Stage 1:** Debridement and explanatation
        - Can use revision acronym **EE** (exposure, extraction)
        - Prepare equipment as in revision THR
        - Need to consider SOFT TISSUE - may need flap coverage after excising sinuses and infected skin
        - Number of samples? > 3 but less than 6 (Parvizi international consensus 2013)
    - **Stage 2: Reimplantation**
        - E, RRR
        - Examine and address bone loss (AORI)
        - Replant with suitable fixation (zonal fixation technique)
        - Need to be concerned about stabiliy - infection may affect the collaterals
            - May need LCCK or a Hinged Knee!
- What is Sonication?
    - Use of US to increase culture yield. (SOA - TTSH does Sonication routinely.)
    
    ![Untitled](Prosthetic%20Joint%20infection%20767b0fc7f4584730bb7c022aceb7379f/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - Parvizi international consensus 2013 – Not for routine. Only for suspected or proven PJI in which aspiration yields no culture OR was given Abx within last 2 weeks
- What antibiotics can be inserted into the Cement?
    - Abx choice = Heat stable
    - **Vancomycin** (1-4g per 40g of cement) and gentamicin or **Tobramycin** (2.4 to 8.4g per 40g cement)
- ‼️⚠️ What are the phases of antibiotics elution?
    - 1st phase - first 10 hours, **30%**
    - 2nd phase - 2 weeks **60%** released
    - 3rd phase - 2-10th week final **10%**
- What if antibiotics are not sensitive to the bacteria?
    - It is ok. due to concept of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration)
    - In view of high concentration locally, antibiotic is able to kill the bacteria due to high concentration
- Dynamic vs Static spacers? Contraindications to articulating spacer?
    - (+) Systematic review by Guild et al. 2014 shows dynamic spacers has **increased ROM**, **reduced re-infection** rate, **facilitated reimplantation** and less bone loss
        - Potentially be left in-situ for longer periods of time if not ready for second stage
    - (-) **Contraindications for articulating spacer -**
        - 1. Incompentant **collaterals** (unstable knee) ➔ may lead to dislocation,
        - 2. **Poor soft tissue** that requires flap coverage (need to be immobilized anyway)
        - 3. Massive **bone loss**
- What are the types of dynamic spacers?
    - all-cement spacer vs real-component spacers
        - Real component spacer also has cement to fix the implant. But total amount of Abx is lower than the all-cement of course
        - Usually metal femur, all -PE tibia component (but can also be tibia metal) - see pictures below
    - Advantages of real-component spacers
        - No difference in ROM between the 2 types
        - Real-component has faster operative time, less blood loss
        - Potentially easier reimplantation in second stage
        - if patient subsequently is too frail for second stage and patient copes well with the real-component spacer, then patient can continue to be mobile
            
            ![Real-component spacer](Prosthetic%20Joint%20infection%20767b0fc7f4584730bb7c022aceb7379f/Screenshot_2022-08-27_at_11.29.07_AM.png)

        Normal all-cement spacer
        
- How does porosity of cement affect properties?
    - Not mixed in vacuum = **high porosity** = increased Abx concentration, higher Abx elution but reduced cement strength
    - Mixed in vacuum = **lower porosity** = reduced abx concentration/ elution, but can be used as WB spacer.
- Weight bearing status for spacers?
    - **Full weight bearing be it articulating or static,**
    - Brace 6 weeks for soft tissue to settle and scar down.
    - Allow full range in brace for articulating spacer.
- How do you manage soft tissue defects?
    - Will require working with plastics colleagues
    - First stage explant ➔ relook until negative cultures ➔ flap ➔ second stage thru flap.
    - Understading risk to flap in second stage. Will need to work with plastics colleagues to plan incision
- How much antibiotic to mix in cement?
    - 1 pack of cement is 40g
    - As such you can give up to 4g of vancomycin powder
    - if > 10%, may affect mechanical properties
- What antibiotic choice and duration?
    - Levo-floxacin + Rifampicin good for Staph Aureus
        
        ![Untitled](Prosthetic%20Joint%20infection%20767b0fc7f4584730bb7c022aceb7379f/Untitled%206.png)
        
- Timing between debridement and reimplantation?
    - No consensus and vary from 2 weeks to several months
    - “MDT with ID giving culture directed Abx for 6/52 with trending of inflammatory markers ➔ 2/52 Abx free period ➔ Reimplantation
- Will you consider single stage revision?
    - Advantages of Single stage are faster rehab, shorter stay
    - Studies found to have similar re-infection rates, but the r*esults are from large centers with large volumes.*
    - Systematic review by Thakrar et al. JBJS 2019 concludes that it is an plausible form of treatment in the
        1. **absence of immunocompromise and** 
        2. **concurrent sepsis**
        3. **resistant bacteria**
        4. **sinus tract**.
    - However, in my hands I will proceed with conventional two staged procedure
- If patient has poor co-morbid what other options? [Salvage options]
    - 1. 1 stage with articulating spacer as definitive with Abx suppression
    - 2. Above knee **amputation**
    - 3. **Arthrodesis**
    - 4. Excision arthroplasty
- ‼️ What if **MSIS - (not conclusive)**?
    - If suspicion of PJI, I will proceeed to list for Debridement with frozen section as per the MSIS consensus paper in 2018, looking for  [3 things]
        - **Pus** and
        - **bacteria** under histology.
        - **Neutrophils** number
    - 400/5/5
    - Musculoskeletal Infection Society to be diagnostic of periprosthetic joint infection is “greater than **five neutrophils** per high-power field in **five high-power fields** observed from histologic analysis of periprosthetic tissue at **×400 magnification.”**
    - If however, if multiple sets of intraop frozen section is negative, and implant is stable, I will proceed to do debridement and liner exchange.
    - If my suspicision is very high (red swollen knee), I will do a two stage revision. If patient is poor comorbids, can do liner exchange with Abx suppression/
- Salvage options?
    - Resection arthroplasty
    - Fusion
