    - **Young and Burgees**
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled.png)
        
        - **APC 1** = Symphysis widening **< 2.5cm**
            - APC 2 = + anterior SIJ disrupted (widening **> 2.5cm**)
            - APC 3 = + posterior SIJ disrupted
        - **LC1** = Unilateral Pubic rami + Ipsilateral Sacral buckle fractures
            - LC 2 = + Ipsilateral Iliac wing # (aka **crescent** fracture)
            - LC3 = + Contralateral SIJ
        - Vertical shear
        - **Stable** = APC 1, LC 1, LC 2
        - **Unstable** = APC 2, APC 4, LC 3, VS
    - **Tile Classification**
        - Type A = **Stable** fractures
        - Type B = **Rotationally unstable, vertical stable** (APC 1/2/3, LC 1/2)
        - Type C = **Rotationally + Vertically unstable** (LC 3, VS or + acetabular fracture)
- What is the most common pattern?
    - Mixed type LC/ VS most common
- Which pattern highest risk for urethral injuries?
    - "Inwardly displaced" parasymphyseal fracture > 1cm
- Where is blood loss usually from? Which type highest blood loss?
    1. Mostly from **venous plexus.** 
    2. **Arterial** only in 10%
        1. Most common **Superior gluteal artery** - posterior ring, APC pattern
        2. Internal pudendal and Obturator arteries (LC types)
    3. **Cancellous** Bone
    - APC3 highest blood loss and mortality
    - In terms of blood loss, APC > VS > LC
- Which type has **highest concomittant rate of head injury**?
    - LC 3
    - LC more associated with chest and brain injuries!
- What fracture should lead us to higher suspicion of unstable injury and more serious?
    - L5 transverse process fracture; avulsion of the **Iliolumbar ligament**
    - L5 Iliolumbar.pdf
- Which nerve root usually injured in Pelvic fractures?
    - L5 nerve root travels along the anterior surface of the S1 vertebral body and sacral ala
    - A/w Denis Zone 1 Fractures (5%)
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%201.png)
        
- What special XR views?
    - Inlet/ Outlet views
        - Inlet views - can see **AP** translation
        - Outlet views can see **Vertical** displacement
    
    ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%202.png)
    
- What is the **acute management** of a hemodynamically unstable patient with pelvic fracture?
    - 1. **ATLS**
    - 2. Pelvic **binder** centered on the GT, to stabilize **venous** clots
    - 3. **MTP** 1:1:1 (PCT, platelet, Plasma), resuscitation
    - 4. IV **TXA** - based on CRASH 2 trial if < 3 hours
    - 5. Check for **urological/ GIT** injury - high riding prostate, open fracture through rectum
    - 6. **Permissive hypotension** to avoid disruption of clot
    - Assess if transient or permanent responder
    - If still **unstable** ➔ possibly bleeding from **arterial** sources ➔ CT angiogram
    - If still **unstable** ➔ consider Ex fix and pelvic packing and repeat angiography
- ‼️ How do you apply a pelvic binder?
    - Minimum requirement of 5 people
    - **4 people to do log roll for secondary survey** - one at head for inline stability, 1 at shoulder, and 1 at hip and another at the lower limbs with intercrossed hands
    - when lying to side, extra person pushes pelvic binder across before letting the patient back supine.
    - At the level of the GT.
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%203.png)
        
- What is your **acute** management?
    - After ATLS protocol + **4 things** - MTP, Pelvic binder, Permissive Hypotension, IV TXA
    - Assess what kind of responder
        - **Non responder** ➔ immediate OT with vascular, for on table angio, Ex fix and Pelvic packing
        - **Transient** Responder ➔ CT Angiogram + embolization
        - Responder ➔  CT Angio
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-07-29 at 2.19.13 PM.png](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Screenshot_2022-07-29_at_2.19.13_PM.png)
        
- What kind of CT-angiogram?
    - "Triple Phase" CT with arterial, portal venous and delayed phase.
- How do you do pelvic packing?
    - It is extraperitoneal packing (specifically retroperitoneum)
    - Done via a vertical midline incision from pubic symphysis extending up 6-8cm, bladder is retracted and 3 laparatomy pads are placed in retroperitoneal space on each side towards the iliac vessels
    - If laparatomy is necessary, incisions should remain separate to maintain effective tamponade
    - Packs need to removed after 48 hours
- When will you avoid a pelvic binder?
    - In LC type fractures ➔ hypothetical risk of over rotation of hemipelvis and injury to hollow viscus like bladder.
- How long can pelvic binder be left there?
    - Should be loosened after **24 hours** to prevent skin necrosis
- ‼️ What kind of Ex-fix will you use? How do you insert them?
    - **Low route Ex fix (aka supra-acetabular) -**
        - (+) Biomechanically more stable than high route ex-fix, **better access to abdomen**
        - (-) LFCN injury - use a drill sleeve,
            - inferior breach -  joint involvement
            - posterior breach - sciatic nerve injury
            - inner table breach -  organ injury
        - Technique:
            - Incision 2cm inferior and medial to ASIS, Aim 20 deg medial, 20 deg cranial; use II to check -
            - **OO view to see tear drop**,
                
                ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%204.png)
                
            - **IO view** – ensure above greater sciatic notch
                
                ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%205.png)
                
    - **High route Ex fix (aka iliac crest)**
        - Incision 2cm posterior to ASIS (thickest portion of ilium) - should not be positioned within 1.5 cm from ASIS due to risk of LFCN injury
        - K-wires can be placed along inner and outer tables of iliac wing
        - Opening drill, then use Pin to insert manually
        - Avoid perforation of inner or outer tables. If were to perforate, perforate medially
    - **Pelvic C clamp** - for unstable C-type fractures
        - Intersection between longitudinal axis of femur and perpendicular line from ASIS
        - Incision ➔ pins inserted 1cm in ➔ compress clamps
- What are relative contraindications to ex fix?
    - [Do not mention these at first go]
    - Fractures that involve the iliac wing (LC 2, 3) and Loss of posterior SIJ (APC3, VS)
    - Loss of posterior SIJ will lead to the loss of tension band to compress against
    - C-Clamp will be suitable for APC3, VS
- What are the contraindications to C-clamp?
    - Fractures within the ilium (LC 2, 3) ➔ risk of pin perforation through the fracture lines
- ‼️ What is the definitive management for unstable pelvic fractures?
    - "Definitive Mx will need to address the posterior and anterior rings"
    - I will fix the **posterior ring** first with Sacroiliac screws - done with patient **supine**
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Address the **anterior ring** with Symphyseal plating via a Pfannestial approach or In-fix
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - Iliac wing fractures can be addressed with Screw fixation (same trajectory as a low route ex fix)
- Symphyseal plate vs In-fix?
    - Consider In fix for obese, women, or child bearing age (removable)
    - (-) LFCN injury in 25%, Require removal in 3-6 months

- What are the safe zones for SIJ screw insertion?
    - "Safe zone is marked by the iliac cortical densities on the **lateral** view, within the S1 vertebrae on the **inlet** view and cranial to the S1 foramen on the **outlet** view. "
    - Out of this, risk of injury to S1 and L5 nerve roots
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - **Lateral view** - ensure **iliac cortical densities (ICD)** are lined up. The ICD marks the **anterosuperior boundary**. Penetrating this may injury L5 nerve root.
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - **Outlet** view - identify sacral foramina (for Superior inferior positioning).
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - **Inlet** view - identify S1 body (for AP positioning)
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- What are considerations in inserting the sacroiliac screws?
    - Sacral dysmorphism with the S1 **not recessed into pelvis and a more acute angulation of the sacrum** in the axial plane
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2012.png)
        
    - Solution: SI screws through S1 must be **obliqued, angled superiorly and anteriorly**
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2013.png)
        
    - **Transiliac screws cannot be placed in S1 but S2**
    - Alex, Yik, Gavin et al. Navigation does not prevent cortical breach of S1 in dysmorphism; consider S2 screws instead

### FRAGILITY PELVIC FRACTURES

- What classification for fragility pelvic fractures?
    - Rommens Classification
    - Type 1 = anterior pelvic ring fracture only
    - Type 2 = Non displaced unliateralposterior pelvic ring fracture
    - Type 3 = Displaced unilateral posterior pelvic ring fracture
    - Type 4 = Displaced bilateral posterior pelvic ring fractures
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2014.png)
        
- Management of fragility pelvic fractures?
    - Types 1, 2 ➔ non operative
    - Type 3 ➔ rarely heal sponatneously, recommend op
    - Type 4 ➔ must be treated with surgical fixation to restore stability

### Acetabular Fractures [Approach different from Pelvis!]

- ‼️ What classification for acetabular fractures?
    - Judet and Letournel Classification
    - **5 Elementary (PW most common)**
        - 1️⃣ Posterior wall only,
        - Anterior Wall, Posterior column, anterior column,
        - Transverse = Both columns disrupted with NO OTHER FRACTURES
    - **5 Associated**
        - 3️⃣ Transverse + **posterior wall** (20%) = “both column lines disrupted with intact obturator ring with posterior wall fracture"
        - 2️⃣ Associated bi columnar (22%) = **Transverse** + Iliac wing + #Obturator ring # + Spur sign on **OO** view.  "No part of articular surface attached to axial skeleton"
        - Anterior Column + posterior hemitransverse = **Transverse** +   ****Obturator ring # + iliac wing # **[Classic pattern in osteoporotic Acetabular fractures]**
            
            ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2015.png)
            
        - T-type = **Transverse** + Obturator ring # ONLY
        - Posterior wall + posterior column
            
            ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2016.png)
            
- What are the 3 most common patterns of acetabular fracture?
    1. Posterior wall only
    2. ABC
    3. Transverse + posterior wall
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2017.png)
        
- Lines on XR?

    ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2018.png)
    
- What are the special views for Acetabular fractures? Special signs?
    - Iliac oblique (P**I**C**O**) - To see Posterior Column + Anterior Wall
    - Obturator oblique - To see Anterior column + Posterior wall
    - **Spur sign** = represents most caudal part of intact ilium due to medialization of artciular components on OO view. Pathognomonic for ABC
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2019.png)
        
    - **Gull sign** = represents impaction fracture of the superiomedial dome
    
    ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2020.png)
    
- How to read CT scan?
    
    ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2021.png)

- What neurovascular structure may be injured in acetabular fractures?
    - Superior Gluteal NV bundle - exits at greater sciatic notch and can become tethered at fracture site
    
    ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2023.png)

- Definitive treatment of **isolated posterior wall** fracture?
    - Will depend on the stability of the fracture
    - Literature describes few ways to determine stability.
        - **1. Determine by size.** Various cut-offs described - 20%/ 40%/ 50%
        - **2. Dynamic stress views**: Tornetta also reccomends dynamic assessment under fluoroscopy to assess stability ➔ this is done under GA; hips IR and ER, extension and abducted ➔ "Sufficient force to rock the patient on table was applied in the direction of the displacement for the given pattern" ➔ evaluate for change in congruence of the head in respect to the acetabulum
        
        [Tornetta stress views.pdf](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Tornetta_stress_views.pdf)
        
- Definitive treatment of **ABC**? What is secondary Congruence?
    - Management will be based on patient and injury factors
    - Patient - comorbids, age, fitness for op
    - Injury - ABC with loss of joint congruence, displaced > 2mm.
    - "I am aware of the principle of secondary congruence in ABC, but also know that higher joint pressures from biomechanicl studies. Thus if patient is fit, I am inclined to offer surgery"
    - Letournal described the concept of secondary congruence whereby complete separation of all articular fragemnts lead to an extra-anatomical orientation around the femoral head
    - However, biomechanical studies (levine et al.) found increased peak pressure in the roof with conservative management with potential risk of developing secondary OA
    
    [Does Secondary congruence work.pdf](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Does_Secondary_congruence_work.pdf)
    
    [Levine Secondary Congruence.pdf](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Levine_Secondary_Congruence.pdf)
    
- ‼️ What approach to address what area?
    - Anterior approaches - AC, AW, Quadrilateral plate
    - Posterior approaches - PC, PW, can do trochanteric flip to evaluate joint
- What to look for on CT scan?
    - **Marginal impaction** (most important)
    - intra-articular fragments, fracture comminution,
- What is marginal impaction? Which type has highest?
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-23 at 9.13.40 AM.png](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Screenshot_2022-08-23_at_9.13.40_AM.png)
    
    - Intra-articular fracture with subchondral bone flipped perpendicular to femoral head.
    - Most **posterior wall** fractures comes marginal impaction.
- ‼️ Definitive treatment of other Acetabular fractures?
    - Treatment depends on patient and injury factors
    - **Injury factors** - Looking at CSW (commercial social worker) - **C**ongruency (> 2mm step), **S**tability (dynamic instability), **W**eight bearing area
    - **C -**  Is fracture congruent?
        - > 2mm = higher risk of OA
    - **S** - Stability
    - **W -** Determine if weight bearing using Roof arc angles by Matta et al. on XR or CT scan
        - **XR roof arc angles** angle from vertical of fracture on all 3 views underwent several revisions
            - Original Matta angles are medial > 30, Anterior >40 on OO, Posterior > 50 on IO = means non weight bearing
        - CT - see if fracture involve 10mm inferior to vertex. Corresponds to 45 ° roof arc measurements
        - **Look at axial view, cut down from sourcil**
            
            ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2025.png)
            
    - If patient is not fit for surgery/ elderly - can choose THR in later date
- What is the corona mortis?
    - anastomosis between external iliac [inferior epigastric] and internal iliac [obturator] vessels behind superior pubic ramus
    
    ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2026.png)
    
- Fixation techniques for acetabulum?
    - Column screws
    - Hip reconstructive plates that are malleable
    
- How do you convert acetabulum fixation to THR?
    - Aware of possible screws - can cut these screws and burr them down.
    - **Impaction bone grafting** with **cemented** socket.

### Sacral Fractures

- Classification of Sacral fractures?
    - By relation to sacral foramina - **Denis**
        - 1 = lateral to foramina; most common 50%; risk of nerve injury 6%
        - 2 = Thru Foramina – 28% nerve injury
        - 3 = Medial to foramina 57%
    - By shape
        - Transverse
        - Spinopelvic dissociation
        - H-shape
        - U-shape
- Management of Sacral fractures?
    - Undisplaced < 1cm = conservative
    - Displaced > 1 cm = ORIF

### Hip Dislocation

- Which direction most common?
    - Posterior - 85%
- What nerves are commonly injured in hip dislocation?
    - Sciatic nerve, peroneal division
    - **Lumbosacral plexus roots**
    
    [Posterior dislocation of the hip producing lumbosacral nerve-root avulsion. A case report - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5057103/)
    
- Which part of sciatic nerve is commonly injured and why?
    - Injury to sciatic nerve – most commonly peroneal division due to 3 reasons
    - 1. **Peroneal division is tethered** at the fibular neck and the sciatic notch, whereas the tibial division only is tethered at the sciatic notch. So **less excursion**
    - 2. **Deeper and nearer to hip joint**
    - 3. **Larger nerve fascicles**
- ‼️ How do you classify hip dislocation?
    - Thomas Epstein Classification
        
        ![Untitled](Pelvic%20Acetabular%20Sacral%20Fractures%20Hip%20Dislocation%20ac0eb595b85547b2aef14e43c6e2102e/Untitled%2027.png)
        
    - 1 = No or insignificant posterior wall #
    - 2 = large posterior wall #
    - 3 = Comminuted posterior wall #
    - 4 = Acetabular floor #
    - 5 = with Femoral head #
- How do you know this is posterior dislocation?
    - Head appears smaller, Dislocation is superior
    - in Posterior dislocation, **LT is less visible** due to internal rotation
    - In Anterior dislocation, LT is more visible due to external rotation

- What is the leg position in dislocation?
    - In posterior - it is shortened and INTERNALLY rotated (smaller LT)
    - In posterior - it is shortened and externally rotated (larger LT)

- ‼️ What are you looking for in the initial XR in hip dislocation?
    - Concomitant NOF # - this means i CANNOT reduce it. I will need to get an urgent CT scan
    - Associated acetabulum fractures, head fractures.
- What is the acute management of posterior hip dislocation?
    - **Reduce ➔ KIV traction ➔ CT scan**
    - Reduce with Allis maneuver

    - Requires 2 person. One to stabilize pelvis, One to climb above patient to provide upward pull of femur with IR and ER.
    - **Other maneuvers =**
    - Bigelow maneuver - using forearm as lever
    - Captain Morgan maneuver - using knee as lever
- How do you reduce **anterior hip dislocation**?
    - Also Allis maneuver
    - The practitioner holds the affected leg just below the knee and, while slightly flexing the hip, applies **constant traction to the hip joint along the long axis**.
    - The hip may be internally rotated and adducted.
    - A **gentle lateral force** to the thigh may be of some assistance.
- What kind of temporary traction?
    - Hamilton Russell Traction
    - [Traction Principles](https://workflowy.com/#/fcecfa3ae42e)
- What are you looking for on CT scan?
    - CT scan with fine cuts to evaluate marginal impaction, fracture fragments, loose body, femoral neck fracture!
    - Marginal impaction = articular fragments and subchondral bone impacted against underlying cancellous bone

- Is there an ideal timing of reduction?
    - JOT 2013 - **> 12 hours,** significant unsatisfactory results.
    - Traditionally, aim to reduce **< 6 hours**

- Definitive treatment of simple Epstein Thompson 1 Hip dislocation?
    - Non operatively, PWB x 6/52
- Definitive treatment of **isolated posterior wall** fracture?
    - Will depend on the stability of the fracture
    - Literature describes few ways to determine stability.
    - **1. Determine by size.** Various cut-offs described - 20%/ 40%/ 50%
    - **2. Dynamic stress views**: Tornetta also reccomends dynamic assessment under fluoroscopy to assess stability ➔ this is done under GA; hips IR and ER, extension and abducted ➔ "Sufficient force to rock the patient on table was applied in the direction of the displacement for the given pattern" ➔ evaluate for change in congruence of the head in respect to the acetabulum

- What are the long term complications of this injury/ surgery?
    - AVN, heterotopic ossification

## HIP DISLOCATION + FEMORAL NECK #

- When do you **NOT not attempt closed reduction and get CT scan first**?
    - if there is a concomittant NOF fracture or if suspected ➔ Do CT scan first "in my institution, I can get it in an hour" ➔ plan for open reduction and ORIF
    - this is to avoid risk of further displacement (AVN), also not possible to mobilize the head with NOF#
- How do you manage **hip dislocation with femoral neck** fracture?
    - if # non displaced ➔ fixed neck first then reduce
    - if # displaced ➔ open reduction into acetabulum first then fix femoral neck
