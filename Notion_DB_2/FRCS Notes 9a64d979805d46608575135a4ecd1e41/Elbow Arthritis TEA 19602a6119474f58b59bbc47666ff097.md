Topic: Shoulder Elbow

- Causes of **stiff** elbow?
    - **Intra-articular** causes - Arthritis (RA, OA, Post traumatic), post infection, loose body
    - **Extra-articular** causes - capsular contractures, contractures of ligaments, muscle contractures, heterotopic ossification
    - M**ixed**
- What is the most common cause of **Elbow Arthritis**?
    - Etiology - **most common cause is RA**, then post traumatic
    - Primary OA is rare
    - Others - previous OCD, infection...
- What is the functional ROM of elbow?
    - Functional arc = 30 - 130 °. ROM is 100 °; **50/50** of P/S.
- How do you differentiate RA vs OA on XR?
    - RA has periarticular **osteopenia**, “panarticular”, absence of osteophytes
- What is a flail elbow? Causes?
    - A flail joint is one which the patient has no control of the joint in flexion / extension or both and whose forearm hands dependant wherever the upper arm is positioned.
    - **Trauma** - Distal humerus non union, Severe trauma with bone loss, Chronic fracture dislocations
    - **Infection** - Explanted TEA and infection
    - **Nerve** - Neurogenic causes
- ‼️ What clinical features? What nerve to check? (in PE)
    - Elbow OA will present with loss of terminal extension
    - Pain only at end range of ROM
    - Clicking, locking
    - Check **stability** - due to ligament attenuation from synovitis
    - Check **neurology** -
        - **ulnar nerve** - cubital tunnel syndrome commonly seen, thought to be due to osteophytes pressing on nerves.
        - **PIN** - synovitis/ panus
- What is the classification for RA Elbow?
    - **Larsen** Grading
    - Stage 1 - soft tissue, normal XR
    - Stage 2 - periarticular erosions
    - Stage 3 - Marked joint space narrowing
    - Stage 4 - Advanced erosions penetrating subchondral bone plate
    - Stage 5 - Advanced joint damage + **Subluxation**
- How can you classify the **management** options?
    - Joint preserving - Open (column procedure), Arthroscopic (Debridement/ OK)
    - Joint sacrificing - Replacement/ fusion
- What is **Outerbridge- Kashiwagi** procedure?
    - Originally described as an open procedure known as “ulnohumeral arthroplasty” in 1986
    - Midline incision at olecranon ➔ Triceps muscles split ➔ A hole 1.2- 1.5m in diameter opened with chisel in the olcranon fossa ➔ Osteophytes removed from anterior compartment

    - Savoie described arthroscopic version of the procedure in 1999 with “fenestration“ of the olecranon fossa.
    - Which direction will you direct the trephine? (Superior to prevent damage to cartilage!)
- What is the **column** procedure?
    - Column procedure is a limited lateral approach that allows for joint arthrotomy, release of the capsule, and excision of osteophytes.
    - It elevates the muscles from the **anterior and posterior aspects** of the lateral paracondylar osseous ridge ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9840628/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9840628/))
    - It allows for anterior and posterior capsular release and exposure adequate to remove osteophytes from the coronoid process and olecranon.

- What are the surgical principles of management of elbow arthritis?
    - OK procedure (open or arthroscopic debridement) only eliminates pain due to terminal impingement
    - If **pain at mid arch** range, then pain cannot be eliminate pain with OK procedure ➔ consider **interpositional arthroplasty** ➔ will eventually need total elbow arthroplasty
    - If patient has pain on prono-supination or pain in radiocapitellar joint ➔ can consider **radial head excision**
- What is interposition arthroplasty?
    - Joint interposed with achilles tendon allograft/ ITB autograft
    - (+) No weight restriction like TEA. Good for younger patients
    - Good interim treatment for severe OA
    - Main complication = early elbow instability
- What are the Rheumatoid Pre-Operative considerations?
    - **Anaethesia** review - Cervical instability, kiv fibreoptic kiv regional
    - **Medication** titrations -
        - *Methotextrate* - **continue** as no impact on wound healing
        - *Non biological DMARDS*e.g. Azathioprine - **continue**
        - *Biologics* e.g. TNF alpha inhibitor - **stop** 2-4 weeks before as they affect wound healing
        - *Steroids* - may need stress dose
    - **Intraop** for RA - osteopenia (intra op fractures) ➔ stand by contraint implants/ supplemental fixation, cemented implants
    - **Post op** for RA - wound care paramount - higher risk of infection

## TOTAL ELBOW ARTHROPLASTY

- What are the types of TEA?
    - Linked and **fully constrained** hinged design [Historical]
        - First designs were linked
        - High cement bone interface stresses
    - **Unlinked**
        - Developed due to aseptic loosening in linked designs
        - Soft tissue ligaments must be intact
    - **Linked but semi constrained** = Sloppy hinge**
- What are the design features of the contemporary TEA?
    1. **Sloppy** hinge - Allows 8 deg varus/ Valgus. 
        - Less constraint = Less cement- bone interface stress
    2. Presence of **anterior flange** in Coonrad- Morrey design to provide **rotational stability** and reduce osteolysis and wear
    3. Added **bone block** at trochlea to **increase bone stock** where maximum stress occurs
    4. **Titanium** material - similar stiffness to bone
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the post op weight limitations?
    - Repetitive load **2** pounds (**900g)**
    - Single load **10** pounds (**4.5kg**)
- What complications?
    - As per Danish Registry -
    - Most common = **aseptic loosening**
    - Second = periprosthetic fracture
    - 3rd = **infection**
    - Bushing wear?
- What is the survivabiliy of the TEA?
    - Based on the Danish Registry, overall 10 year survival is 81% [similar to HTO and UKA dettoni]
    - However with the newest sloppy hinge design, 10 year survival is **88%**. Unlinked designs had higher rates of revision

- What approach for TEA?
    - Will require an extensile approach e.g. Bryan Morrey or TRAP approach
    - Cannot use olecranon osteotomy.
    - Other option is a paraolecranon approach
        - [https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(13)00962-3/fulltext#:~:text=The lateral para-olecranon approach avoids triceps tendon detachment from,to a triceps splitting approach](https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(13)00962-3/fulltext#:~:text=The%20lateral%20para%2Dolecranon%20approach%20avoids%20triceps%20tendon%20detachment%20from,to%20a%20triceps%20splitting%20approach).
- Any difference in outcomes in TEA for RA vs post-traumatic OA?
    - Different etiologies
    - in RA, we expect more instability due to ligament attenuation.
        - RA - higher risk of septic loosening
    - in post-traumatic **OA, we expect more stiff** ligaments
        - OA - higher risk of bushing wear, axle failure and component disassembly, intra-operativ fractures

## FUSION

- Arthrodesis Angle for elbow?
    - Unilateral = **90** deg flexion (for feeding), **10 ° in supination!**
    - Bilateral
        - One in 90 deg
        - One in slight extension 65 deg for perineal care
