### OA Knee

[30. Osteoarthritis Basic Science](30%20Osteoarthritis%20Basic%20Science%20454732f15933452ea333ac17f3cab5ac.md) 

- Why varus more common than valgus?
    - Because the body center of mass goes medially and thus, more load goes through the medial compartment
- ‼️ ⚠️ How do you classify OA Knee?
    - Kellgren and Lawrence - **D/P/D**
    - Grade 0 = No OA
    - 1 = some osteophyte lipping. **Doubtful** space narrowing
    - 2 = Minimal = definite osteophytes, **possible** joint space narrowing
    - 3 = Moderate = **definite narrowing**, multiple osteophytes
    - 4 = Severe = **bone on bone**

- How do you do Skyline XR?
    - Patient on supine, knees bent on foam, patient holds cassette, XR beam shoots from caudal
        
        ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%201.png)
        
- How do you do Rosenberg XR? Reason?
    - 3 points
        - Rosenberg XR is a **PA** (not AP) XR of the knee,
        - patient stands against XR cassette and **bends to 45 degrees**,
        - XR beam is shot from **10 degrees** towards caudal direction
    - It is meant to be more sensitive than standard WB radiographs to detect joint space narrowing

- OA knee - Non Op Management? Which guidelines?
    - UK NICE 2019 Guidelines
        - **Analgesia** - WHO ladder, Oral and Topical
        - **Weight loss** and therapy
        - Intra-articular **steroid** can be considered
        - DO NOT OFFER - Glucosamine, acupuncture, intra-articular HA
    - JAAOS OA Knee CPG 2013
        - 3 reccomended - Activity modification, weight loss, analgesia
        - 5 not reccomended - glucosamine and chondroitin, IA HA, Acupuncture, Arthroscopic debridement, lateral heel wedges

- Evidence for Glucosamine?
    - **GAIT** Trial 2008 in NEJM
    - RCT of 1583 patients into Placebo vs G+C. Outcomes shows no difference between glucosamine vs placebo except small subset with moderate-severe pain (22% of patients)
        
        [GAIT Trial.pdf](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/GAIT_Trial.pdf)
        

- Evidence for Hyaluronic Acid Injection?
    - Controversial
    - “Aware that NICE guidelines, JAAOS do not reccomend it however, Cochrane reviews 2006 suggest short term benefits”
    - **Cochrane reviews 2006**
        - 28 trials comparing IA steroids against IA HA
        - Short term benefits established for Steroids
        - Response to HA products appears more durable, but not consistent
        - Cochrane reviews for viscosupplementation 2006 - found to be effective treatment for OA with beneficial effects 5-13 weeks post injection
    - Henry et al. RCT -
        - compared HA with NS injection - no difference
    - JBJS review by Bhandari - suggest possible favouraing HA

- Any role for arthroscopy?
    - **JAAOS** CPG guidelines **do not reccomend** Arthroscopic surgery for OA knees.
    - **NICE** guidelines suggest **selective use** in very young, **mechanical** symptoms.
    - Aware of Seminal paper **Moseley et al. NEJM 2002**
        - RCT 180 into 3 groups – arthroscopic debridement, lavage and placebo (with incisions and sound effects)
        - No difference in outcomes
        
        [moseley2002.pdf](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/moseley2002.pdf)
        
    - [Systematic review and MA by Thorlund et al. 2015](https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2747)
        - Small benefit on pain at 3 and 6 months but not later up to 24 months
        - No significant benefit on physical function
        - Associated with DVT in 4 per 1000 patients
        - Do not support arthroscopic surgery for middle aged or older patients
    - If asked about controversy ➔ However, aware of paper in JBJS by Aaron et al. in 2006, cross sectional study of 122 patients.
        - **90%** of patients with mild OA as defined by joint space > 3mm and no deformity improved with arthroscopic debridement
        - While only **25 %** improved in patients with severe arthritis with joint space < 2mm

### HTO

- What is difference between HTO and UKA?
    - Principle in HTO is to realign the weight bearing axis from varus to slight valgus
    - UKA is not a realignment procedure.
- Contraindications to HTO?
    - Patient factors - Obesity BMI > 40
    - Disease factors - Inflammatory OA, tricomparmental, previous menisectomy, deficient collateral ligaments
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the types of HTO? Difference?
    - Lateral Closing Wedge
        - Cons: Need 2 osteotomy (fibula), CPN palsy, leg shortening,
    - Medial Opening Wedge
        - Pros - preserves bone stock, no risk to CPN, less dissection
        - Cons: Higher incidence of **Baja** (circumvent with biplanar osteotomy), Not immediate FWB (Controversial), risk of Non union, increases **tibia slope**
        
        ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%203.png)
        
        ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - No difference for outcome, pain, function or complications
- What is the influence on **tibial slope** by opening vs closing wedge?
    - **Opening wedge** - increases tibial slope
        - Anteromedial tibia cortex makes 45 ° with posterior cortex
        - Lateral cortex is perpendicular to posterior cortex
        - Thus, medial opening wedge with equal spaces in anterior and posteriormedial will result in increased tibia slope
    - **Closing wedge** - reduces tibial slope

- How is tibial slope measured?
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-07-23 at 12.07.43 PM.png](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Screenshot_2022-07-23_at_12.07.43_PM.png)
    
    - Measure of angle between the tanget to medial tibia plateau and the ling perpendicular to the tanget of the posterior tibial cortex
- How do you perform a opening wedge HTO?
    - Preop - Templating
    - Intraop
        - Supine, tourniquet
        - I - midway **between tibia tubercle and posteromedial border of tibia**
        
        ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%205.png)
        
        - D - retract Pes anserinus laterally, subperiosteal elevation of sMCL
        - **Starting** point - **4-5cm distal to joint lin**e; aim to tip of fibula
        - Leave 1cm of bone to prevent lateral hinge fracture
        - 2nd osteotomy at anterior 1/3 of tibia at angle of 135 deg
        - Sequential correction with osteotomes - every 1mm = 1 deg
        - Apply plate
    - Post op
        - Short period of partial weight bearing - 2 weeks before FWBAT is reasonable
        - HTO WB.pdf
- How do you know how big the opening wedge?
    - Rule of thumb is 1mm for every degree, check intra op with long rod
    - Other option is **Hernigou table** based on the length of osteotomy and the desired angle of correction to give you the length of wedge

        Measuring of length of the osteotomy
        
- How do you **template the cut**?
    - I use the “**Dugdale** Method”
    - Several methods - using lateral tibia spine or fujisawa point
    - **Fujisawa point** =. **62.5%** from medial tibia plateau (or lateral tibia spine)
        - 1st line = Line from Femoral head to Fujisawa point
        - 2nd line = Line from middle of ankle to Fujisawa point
    - Difference = Osteotomy angle (for both lateral closing or medial opening)

- How do you compensate for ACL or PCL deficiency?
    - If ACL deficient ➔ decrease slope
    - If PCL deficiency ➔ increase slope so tibia move forward
    
    ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%207.png)
    
- Any difference using fujiswawa point vs lateral tibia spine?
    - Similar outcomes. But if aim lateral tibia spine, slightly less corrected
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32037235/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32037235/)
- Do we need bone grafts?
    - No need
    - El-Assal 2010 58 consecutive HTO up to 14 mm, no bone graft 100% union
- Difference between uniplanar vs Biplanar HTO?
    - Biplanar as described by Lobenhoffer has its vertical limb going superior - i.e. the Tibial tuberosity is attached to the shaft of tibia.
    - The reason for biplanar HTO is to confer more rotational stability, more surface area for union
    - Then we need to know the difference between superior vertical limb vs inferior vertical limb biplanar osteotomy:
        - Superior vertical limb - original described by Lobenhoffer. Theoretically higher risk of Baja
            
            ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%208.png)
            
        - Inferior vertial limb - higher risk of fractures, theoretically lower risk of Baja

- HTO in a ACL deficient knee?
    - Decreasing posterior tibial slope has the ability to improve stability with or without the need for a ligament construction.
    - Option of same setting or staged ACL reconstruction in younger, more active patients.
- Complications of HTO?
    - **Intraop** - lateral hinge fracture, excessive increase in posterior slope
    - **Early Post op** non union, infection, peroneal palsy especially in lateral closing wedge, compartment syndrome, sapehnous nerve palsy
    - **Late Post op** - patella baja,
- What are the types of the lateral hinge fracture?
    - 3 types of lateral hinge fractures
    - Type 1 - fracture reaches just proximal to or within tibiofibula joint (most common)
    - Type 2 = fracture reaches the distal portion of the proximal TF joint
    - Type 3 = lateral tibial plateau fracture

- What are the implications of lateral hinge fracture?
    - Post op hematoma around the fibular neck ➔ CPN palsy
    - According to Takeuchi 2012 Arthroscopy, no complications for type 1 fractures. Type 2 some had delayed union.
    - Type 3 shoulder have a period of NWB for 2/52
- What to do if post TKR/ HTO CPN palsy?
    - **Flex** knee, **remove** compressive dressings, put on foot drop **splint** to prevent contractures
    - MRI/ US to evaluate for hematoma KIV operative exploration and decompression
    - Referral to peripheral nerve surgeons
    - NCS - timing is controversial. Classic teaching is 6 weeks to look for wallerian degeneration. However, now a days moving towards early NCS to look for early dennervation changes on EMG
    - Chronic foot drop ➔ PT tranfer
- Fast progressing TKR into varus in 3-4 years. Reasons?
    - Patient and Surgeon factors
        - **Surgeon** - undercorrection
        - **Patient** - obesity, activity level
    - need TRO **infection**, **loosening of implants/ non union**
- ⚠️ Survival rate of HTO?
    - Based on Finnish registry - **89%** at 5 years, **73%** at 10 years when conversion to TKR taken as end point
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23109632/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23109632/)
    
    ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%2011.png)
    

### **HTO to TKR conversion**

- ‼️ How do you do conversion to TKR? Considerations?
    - Complex revision - PIP - **5 main issues**
        - 1. issues with previous **incision** - try to incorporate
        - 2. **Implant** interference - removal of plate
        - 3. Patellar **baja** - affect eversion kiv quad snip
        - 4. Proximal **tibia deformity** (tibia slope and offset) - may need offset stem; restore the joint line.
        - 5. **PCL is likely unreliable** - will use a PS knee
        - ~~6. **Ligament** imbalance - MCL may be tightened - stand by constraint knee [dont mention this - SOA]~~
    - Pre Op
        - Templating
        - Consider **navigation** due to slope change ➔ may need constrained knee if unable to balance ➔ if constrained knee, then need slope
        - No need **stemmed** implants for the sake of bypassing distal screw holes (Only 25% of post HTO TKR has stems)
        - Standby **offset** stems
        - If LCWHTO ➔ loss of bone stock ➔ may need offset stem
    - Intraop
        - **Incision** – 2 options
            - either new incision with 7cm skin bridge
            - Or incorporate incision with 60 ° angles to preserve blood supply (usually this option if the HTO was medial)
            
            ![IMG_4862.jpg](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/IMG_4862.jpg)
            
        - Patella **baja** – difficulty in eversion. *25% need rectus snip/ VY/ TTO*
    - Post op
        - FWBAT
- How can you address patellar baja intraoperatively?
    - Superior placement of patella component
    - Lower joint line by cutting tibia more AND add distal femoral augmentation
    - Cephalad transfer of Tibia tubercle but risk non union/ extension lag
- Does TKR after HTO affect its success? Success rate of TKR after HTO?
    - Systematic review 2009 - HTO does not compromise subsequent TKR [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720911/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720911/)
    - Based on Finnish Registry, 95.3% at 5 years, 91% at 10 years, 88% at 15 years. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24276363/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24276363/)
    - Slightly lower than TKA without previous HTO (97%, 94%, 90%)

### UKA

- What are the **indications** for UKA? What guidelines is that?
    - I will use the ISAKOS [International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine] Guidelines - 7 factors
        - **Patient factors (3)**
            - Age > **55**
            - BMI < 30
            - Not inflammatory Arthritis - RA, gout
        - **Disease Factors (4)**
            - Minimal mal-alignment Varus < 10 , Valgus < 5
            - Intact **cruciate** and collateral ligaments
            - < 10 ° FFD
            - Pain only at medial compartment; **no PFJOA**
    - However, I am aware that indications have been broadened e.g.
        - **ACL** - differentiate between acute ACL rupture that you can do concomittant ACL recon or chronic ACL with no instability
        - **PFJOA** - accepted to do if OA changes on medial side rather than lateral side

- Technical Pearls for UKA?
    - UKA - aims not to over-correct deformity, but also not under correct leading to varus malposition and higher risk of failure
    - Residual varus > 5-7 ° is associated with increased risk of revision
    - NEVER release the MCL
- Difference between fixed and mobile bearing?
    - Fixed = **flat** so knee kinematics is more natural however higher contact pressure = more wear
    - Mobile = **Curved** poly = higher conformity with reduced contact pressure
    - Technically more difficult
    - Overall – [similar revision rates but different failure mechanisms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76124-z)
        - Fixed - fail due to PE wear
        - Mobile - fail due to dislocation
- Cemented vs uncemented UKA?
    - Cementless may have increased risk of periprosthetic fracfure
- Is ACL deficiency really an absolute contraindication?
    - Controversial; No. Can further break down into 2 types of ACL deficiency
        - Primary ACL deficiency from trauma ➔ has instability
        - Secondary ACL deficiency from degeneration ➔ usually no instability
    - Primary ACL tear from trauma with instability should not undergo UKA
    - ACL deficiency secondary to OA can be considered with papers showing good short to mid term outcomes.
- Is Anterior Knee pain and PFJOA really an absolute contraindication?
    - Controversial with no consensus
    - Hamilton et al. JBJS 15 year F/U of 805 knees for mobile bearing UKA
    - Depends on the area of Patella that has OA
    - Severe damage to the **LATERAL side of PFJ remains a Contraindication**
    - OA changes on **MEDIAL sid**e, however severe does not compromise function or survival
    - Preop AKP does not compromise functional outcome or survival
- How common is UKA spacer dislocation?
    - **Medial** side is 1 in 200 - usually anterior
    - Lateral - 10%!
- Causes of bearing dislocation?
    - **Technical** factors - malposition, unbalanced F/E gap, impingement
    - **Patient** - Trauma injuring the MCL
    - Arising from **complications** - infection, aseptic loosening
- Why does lateral spacer dislocate more commonly?
    - Lateral collateral ligament is slack in flexion, in contrast to the medial side in which the MCL is tight
- Management options of UKA spacer dislocation?
    - Bearing change to **larger** spacer
    - Revision UKA KIV **fixed** bearing
    - Conversion to **TKR**, stand by constrained knee
- ‼️ ⚠️ Evidence for UKA vs HTO?
    - Systematic review by **Dettoni et al.** found no difference in mid and long term follow up of up to 10 years. Survival for both is **80% for both at 10 years**
    
    [HIGH TIBIAL OSTEOTOMY VERSUS UNICOMPARTMENTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY FOR MEDIAL COMPARTMENT ARTHROSIS OF THE KNEE: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958284/)
    
    - They differ slightly in
        - **Indications** - HTO is suited for patients who are of high demand, UKA usually more in low demand patients. Previous HTO
        - **Technical goals** - HTO aim to over correct while UKA does not aim to correct alignment
        - **Conversion challenges** to TKR -
            - 77% of UKA group needed osseous reconstruction due to bone loss
            - More UKA revision needed revision implants like augments and stems
        - HTO higher complication rates e.g. infection due to more soft tissue dissection
- **UKA to TKR Conversion** considerations?
    - Revision - preop, intraop, post op
    - Pre op - standby equipments, explant sets
    - Intraop - EEERR
        - E - extend previous incision
        - E - explant UKA
        - ER - Examine and reconstuct bone loss if any - AORI classification
        - R - Replace with zonal fixation principles - kiv stem
    - Post op - R - FWBAT
- What are the risk factors for post UKA medial tibial plateau fracture?
    - **Patient** Factors - Osteoporosis, Females
    - **Anatomical** factors
        - **Proximal tibia vara** - Medial Eminence line is extra-medullary, resulting in less bone volume supporting the tibia component.

    - **Surgeon** Technical factors -
        - Damage to **posterior** cortex
        - Vertical **overcutting** of medial plateau
        - **Improper pin site** for fixation of tibial cutting block
            
            ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%2012.png)
            
        - **Cementless UKA** - no consensus as studies show comparable incidences of fractures.
            - However, excessive interference fit in cementless UKA in combination with impaction technique may introduce additional risk
            - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33528591/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33528591/)
- What is the management of post UKA medial tibial plateau fracture?
    - Depends on the displacement and stability of the fracture
        - If unstable ➔ revision to UKA or TKR
        - If stable
            - Undisplaced ➔ non op with NWB
            - Displaced ➔ Buttress plating

### Proximal Femoral Osteotomy (PFO)

- What is the theory?
    - Fibula usually takes 6.4% of body weight, acts as a lateral strut
    - With fibula osteotomy, lateral support is weakened and stresses are shifted from the medial compartment to posterolateral compartment of knee
    - Corrects varus deformity.
- Technical pearls
    - Need to be careful of CPN that winds around fibular neck
    - Recommended PFO 4-7cm away from fibular head

## TKR for varus knee

- Medial release sequence of Varus OA knee?
    - **Osteophytes** ➔ **Deep MCL** ➔ assess if flexion or extend tight
        - If tight in flexion ➔ release **anterior sMCL**
        - If tight in extension ➔ release **Posterior oblique portion** of sMCL, PM capsule, semi Mem, Pes Anserinus
- What if soft tissue releases insufficient?
    - Tibial reduction osteotomy – smaller tray and lateralize tray
    - Medial epicondyle osteotomy – fixation is optional ➔ fibrous non union
    

### Special cases

![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%2014.png)

This is not a usual varus knee - note the lateral compartment is also involved ➔ need to think of inflammatory arthritis and implications for op (work up, PS knee, Patella resurfacing)

- Patient has previous distal femur fracture, fixed and ROI
- Now has valgus in distal femur ➔ consider **navigation** to overcome deformity

### SONK

- What is SONK?
    - Subchondral insufficiency fractures in osteopenic bone
    - Insufficiency fractures ➔ fluid accumulation of fluid in bone marrow ➔ focal ischemia and eventual necrosis
- Which site does it usually occur?
    - 90% is on the medial femoral condyle
    
    [Size of osteonecrosis of the knee - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8448962/)
    
- History of SONK?
    - Commonly females 50 yo
    - Sudden onsent of severe knee pain, affecting sleep
- What does MRI show?
    - Bony edema
- Classification of SONK?
    - **Koshino** staging system based on clinical and radiographic features ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7033231/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7033231/))
    - Stage 1 = Pain but normal XR
    - Stage 2 = XR sclerosis
    - Stage 3 = Subchondral **collapse**
    - Stage 4 = Degenerative phase with osteophyte formation around condyles
    
    ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%2015.png)
    
- How can you differentiate this from steroid induced osteonecrosis of femur?
    - Steroid induced ON is not subchondral lesion. it occurs in the body of the condyles.
    - Tends to be multifocal
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-07-23 at 12.21.08 PM.png](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Screenshot_2022-07-23_at_12.21.08_PM.png)
        
- What meniscal injuries is it associated with?
    - Medial meniscus root tear (80% of SONK has medial root tear)
    - Theory is that MM tears ➔ excess loading on tibia plateau ➔ SONK
- What are the risk factors for SONK?
    - Patient factors -
        - Low BMD  ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22537352/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22537352/))
        - Secondary ON of the knee - steroids, alcohol
    - Injuries -
        - Meniscus root tear resulting in higher stresses on knee tibia plateau
- ‼️ Natural history of SONK?
    - Satku JBJS 2003 study of 21 knees in tibia plateau - 3 potential outcomes.
        - 10% (2/21) Acute extensive collapse in 3 months
        - 70% (15/21) - rapid progression to OA in 2 years
        - 20% (4/21) complete resolution
    - Only 25% (5/21) required TKR (2 in extensive collapse + 3 in progression group)

- Management of SONK?
    - Non op
        - Most can be treated with non op
        - Treat osteoporosis
    - Op
        - Joint preserving - root repair, HTO, retrograde drilling of lesion (core decompression)
        - Joint sacrificing - UKA, TKR

### Old Valgus OA Knee [RA]

- Causes of valgus knee
    
    
- What do you look for in physical exam?
    - MCL deficiency
    - CPN palsy
    - Fixed flexion deformity (FFD)
    - NV
- Invx for valgus knee?
    - XR - Knee AP, Lateral, skyline, Long film
    - CT scan for bone stock
- What classification for Valgus knee?
    - Ranawat Classification - Femoral-tibial angle and MCL status
    
    ![Untitled](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Untitled%2016.png)
    
- ‼️ ⚠️ How will you do the valgus knee TKR?
    - Complex primary
    - Pre op
        - Templating
        - What are the Rheumatoid Pre-Operative considerations?
            - **Anaethesia** review - Cervical instability, kiv fibreoptic kiv regional
            - **Medication** titrations -
            - *Methotextrate* - continue as no impact on wound healing
            - *Non biological DMARDS*e.g. Azathioprine - continue
            - *Biologics* e.g. TNF alpha inhibitor - stop 2-4 weeks before as they affect wound healing
            - *Steroids* - may need stress dose
            - **Intraop** for RA - osteopenia (intra op fractures) ➔ stand by contraint implants/ supplemental fixation, cemented implants
            - **Post op** for RA - wound care paramount - higher risk of infection
            - Medications - DMARDS
            - 1 Backlink
                - [Rheumatoid Operative considerations](https://workflowy.com/#/4758c9fa65ee)
        - Implants - PS knee (integrity of PCL is unpredictable), stand by constrained condylar knee, hinged knee
    - Intraop (6 considerations) - approach, bone cuts, releases, defects, Stability and patella
        - 1. **Approach** - medial patellar, expect difficulty in everting patella may need extensile maneuvers
            - Rectus snip, VY turn down or TT Osteotomy
            - However, need to be careful with lateral release to avoid devascularization
        - 2. Bone cuts
            - Distal femur cut - usually 6 ° valgus, have to reduce the valgus cut to 4 °
            - AP femur cuts → **Rotation** assessment ➔ Use whitesides line due to hypoplastic Femoral condyle (not posterior condyle line)
        - 3. **Sequence** of releases [WHat is your sequence of release?](https://workflowy.com/#/0da0d2dc81f0)
            - If alot of release is done ➔ may need hinged implant
        - 4. **Bone Defects** ➔ assess if it is contained or uncontained ➔ used sleeves or wedges
        - 5. **Implant** - **Stem**? If using hinged or Constrained Condylar knee implants ➔ stemmed implants to increase bone implant interface surface area
        - 6. **Patella -** I will replace the patella
    - Post op
        - Check Common peroneal nerve
        - Avoid drain
        - DVT Prophylaxis
- What are the downsides of a medial parapatellar approach?
    - Difficulty eversion
    - Patellar devascularization and AVN - you already do medial approach, then if you do lateral release, you may end up devascularizing the patella
- ‼️ What is your sequence of release in valgus Knee?
    - Many described sequences, but I use the Ranawat Inside-out technique of 7 structures
    - 1. Osteophytes ➔
    - 2. Extend with lamina spreader ➔ remainder PCL ➔
    - 3. Posterolateral capsule ➔
    - 4. ITB pie crusting ➔
    - 5. LCL ➔
    - 6. Popliteus tendon ➔
    - 7. Lateral head of gastroc
    - If instablity detected after releases ➔ Hinged implant
- How do you release the ITB based on Ranawat technique?
    - Inside out technique, avoiding the triangle of **danger** made up of the posterior border of the ITB, the tibia cut surface and the popliteus tendon
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-04 at 9.26.24 AM.png](OA%20Knee%20-%20Varus%20UKA%20HTO%20SONK%20Valgus%2095283d63cdb04d9987e5f701bd309ed5/Screenshot_2022-08-04_at_9.26.24_AM.png)
    
- What specifically do you release if tight in flexion or extension?
    - Tight in **extension** - release ITB
    - Tight in **flexion** - release popliteus;
- How will you manage post op CPN palsy?
    - **Prevention** - careful retractor, consider put a drain
    - **Immediate post op** -
        - Remove compression bandage, FLEX the knee, splint the foot to avoid foot drop contractures
        - XR - look for cement and laterally placed prosthesis (overhang) that may press on CPN
    - If concerns of cut nerve e.g. complete nerve palsy ➔ primary repair
    - If incomplete palsy, likely neuropraxia ➔ most resolve at 3/12
    - I will follow up with EMG/ NCS after 3/12 to evaluate
- Must you correct the valgus deformity? [How can you reduce CPN palsy risk?]
    - Consider **mild undercorrection < 6 degrees**
    - Has found to have no impact on outcomes, also obviate the need for constrained implants

- What percentage will recover?
    - **24 (39%)** complete CPNPs had complete recovery, 34 (56%) had incomplete recovery, and 3 were lost to follow-up.
    - **45 (66%)** with incomplete CPNPs had complete recovery, 18 (27%) had incomplete recovery, and 5 patients were lost to follow-up.
- What to do if there is delayed foot drop?
    - Tendon transfer = tibialis posterior through the Intraosseous membrane to navicular
    
- Any difference between medial or lateral approach?
    - No

- Any difference between **PS or CR** knee in RA knee?
    - According to Cochrane review 2013 - With respect to range of motion, pain, clinical, and radiological outcomes, **no clinically relevant differences** were found between total knee arthroplasty with retention or sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament.

- Any difference in survival in normal OA vs RA TKR?
    - According to AOJNRR, first 3 months, OA has lower revision rate
    - BUT **after 9 months** RA has a LOWER rate of revision compared to OA

- Why PCL may not be affected in RA knee?
    - PCL is an **intra-synovial, yet extra-articular ligament**
    - While ACL is an **intra-articular, extra-synovial ligament**
        - The ACL is an intra-articular but extrasynovial structure, as **two synovial layers envelop it**
