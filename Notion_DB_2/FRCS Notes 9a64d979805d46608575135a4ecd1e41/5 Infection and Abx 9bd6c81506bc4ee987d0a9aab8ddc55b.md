- What is the characteristic of CRP?
    - Elevates within 8-10 hours of onset, peaks within 36-50 hours, falls quickly in 3 days after treatment. 2 weeks to normalise after THR. (Half life 18 hours)
- What is the characteristic of ESR?
    - Elevates within 48-72 hours of infection; returns to nom after 2-4 weeks. Can remain elevated for 1 year after THR!
- What are the types of bacteria? how to classify?
    - By Aerobic/ anaerobic
    - By morphology - cocci, bacillus,
    - By staining - gram staining,
    - By action of enzymes - coagulase +ve -ve
- ‼️ ⚠️ How do you do gram staining?
    - **4 steps - SFWC**
    - Stain with **crystal violet**
    - Fix with **iodine**
    - Wash with **alcohol**
    - Gram +ve = retain purple
    - Gram -ve = becomes pink with the **counterstain** = **safranin- O**
- Why does some bacteria stain purple with gram stain?
    - Due to difference in **thickness of cell wall**
    - Due to thick mesh-like cell wall made of peptidoglycan making up 50-90% of cell envelope. Gram negative bacteria has a thinner layer - only 10% of its width)
- ‼️ What are the types of antibiotics?
    - Best to draw bacteria - Cell wall, Cell membrane 50s and 30s proteins and Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)

- What is MRSA?
    - Staph aureus that acquired **penicillin binding protein (PBP2) encoded by gene mecA**, that allows it to continue synthesizing cell wall even in the presence of beta lactam antibiotics
- How do bacteria like MRSA gain resistance?
    - 2 ways:
        - Spontaneous/ sporadic Mutation
        - Horizontal Gene transfer via **Plasmids** (small circles of DNA)
- How do you Decolonise MRSA in preop patients?
    - **5 days** - intranasal **Mupirocin** TDS + Antimicrobial **Octenisan** wash daily
    - **2 days** after treatment, repeat **3 consecutive swabs in 1 week** to be deisolated
- What if got recent spate of cases of MRSA/ Infection?
    - "This is a clinical governance emergency" - inform clinical director
    - Expect a set **protocolled action plan** to be activated
    - I will inform my clinical lead to **stop all** elective operating
    - Next priority is to provide appropriate care for all patients infected - **MDT**, ID, antibiotics
    - **Committee** set up to investigate and every step of pathway investigated from preop asssessment
    - All staff tested as carriers, check theatre suite for efficiency, ward cleanliness
- What if you as the surgeon is MRSA?
    - I would immediately stop all clinical work and commence eradication therapy to decolonize
    - Patients will be informed of cancellations, work with department to transfer patients to other colleagues
    - Any recent surgical cases will be audited to trace any potential MRSA infections
- What is Clostridium Difficile?
    - Gram positive rod that produces 2 toxins - enterotoxins and cytotoxin ➔ inflammation of gut and diarrhea
    - It is a **normal commensal** of most people gut and usually does not cause problems
    - "oppurtunistic" infection that thrives in gut of patients on long term abx
- How to manage C-Diff outbreak?
    - Initiate PO vancomycin 215mg QDS
    - Multidisciplinary with ID, isolation
- How to prevent C-Diff outbreaks?
    - Appropriate use of Abx - short course and high dose, specific abx
    - Reduce transmission by hand hygeine

## SEPTIC ARTHRITIS

- What are the modes of spread?
    - Hematogenous, direct inoculation, contiguous spread from adjacent OM
- Most common Bacteria? Paeds?
    - Staph aureus, gonococcus, gram negative bacilli
    - **Paeds**
        - Staph Aureus
        - Hemophilius Influenzae
        - Group B streptococus in neonates
        - Sexually active adolescent - Gonococcus
- What classification?
    - Gachter Classification.
        - 1 = synovitis, effusion only
        - 2 = + pus
        - 3 = + cartilage erosions
        - 4 = + bony osseous involvement

- Open vs arthroscopic washout?
    - Bohler et al. KSSTA. 2016 Arthropscopy had lower reinfection rate and better functional outcome
    - **Arthrotomy indicated in Gachter grade 4** septic arthritis with osseous involvement

## **Necrotising Fasciitis**

- What is necrotising Fasciitis?
    - Emergency characterised by fulminant infection that spreads along fascia planes
- What are the types of Necrotising fasciitis?
    - 4 types
        - Type 1 = Polymicrobial
        - 2 = monomicrobialv - usually group A strep
        - 3 = marine vibrio
        - 4 = MRSA
- What causes gas gangrene?
    - Clostridium Perfringens
- ‼️ Any scoring you aware for nec fas?
    - LRINEC score which is developed by Singapore plastic Surgeon Wong Chin Ho in 2004 (Laboratory Risk indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis)
    - Looks at 6 biochemical markers -
        - 2 haematological - Total white, Hb
        - 3 Renal markers - glucose, Cr, Na
        - 1 inflammatory marker - CRP
    - Score > 6, **PPV 92%** for Nec fas
- Invx?
    - XR - gas
    - MRI
- ‼️ Management of necrotising fasciitis? What antibiotics?
    - Triple antibiotics = Penicillins + Ceftazidime + **Clindamycin**
    - + Doxycycline if Marine
    - Surgery = Fasciectomy
- What antibiotics if allergic to penicllin?
    - Linezolid
- What are the principles of fasciectomy?
    - Principles of debridement by Wong Chin-Ho et al. 2008
    - 3 zones identified.
        - 1 - Necrotic zone
        - 2 - infected zone but potentially salvageable
        - 3 - non infected skin.
    - Zone 1 completely excised; Zone 2 assess and cut back as necessary; zone 3 left alone.

### OSTEOMYELITIS

- What are the 2 types of bone in OM?
    - Sequestium = necrotic bone sequestered in middle
    - Involcrum = new bone outside
- What is a cloaca?
    - **Sinus in the cortex of a bone** affected by chronic osteomyelitis that allows the drainage of pus or other material from the bone into the adjacent tissues.

- What is the classification for osteomyelitis?
    - **Cierny-Mader** Classification - looking at location of bone involvement and host
        - Stage 1 = **medullary** canal only
        - 2 = Cortex only
        - 3 = **localised** (medullary + bone)
        - 4 = diffuse
    - **Host**: A = normal, B = compromised, C = treatment worse than infection
- Management of osteomyelitis
    - 1. Thorough debridement till paprika sign, excise unhealthy skin
    - 2. Deep cultures
    - 3. Stabilisation; dead space management
    - 4. Soft tissue coverage
    - 5. Culture directed antibiotics
- Oral vs IV antibiotics?
    - **NEJM 2019 RCT** of 1000 patients which included PJI, spine infections found
    - 6/52 Oral abx noninferior to IV Abx as assessed by treatment failure at 1 year.

### Chronic Non-Bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO)

- What is CNO?
    - Aka Chronic recurrent Multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)
    - Rare auto-inflammatory disorder a/w other autoimmune conditions e.g. Crohn's, UC
- What is the classification?
    - 3 clinical presentations by Jansson et al. 2007
        - Acute Nonbacterial Osteitis (acute NBO)
        - Chronic NBO
        - CRMO
- Diagnosis of CNO/ CRMO?
    - Jansson et al. 2007 Rheumatology Journal proposed major and minor criteria
    - Major - XR sclerotic lesions, multifocal bone lesion, psoriasis, sterile bone biopsy
    - Minor - normal FBC, mild raised CRP ESR, observation time > 6 months, other autoimmune, relatives family history
- Management of CRMO, CNO?
    - NSAIDS
    - IV Bisphosphonates like Zoledronic Acid
    - TNF-Alpha blockers
