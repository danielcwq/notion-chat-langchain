### Base of thumb OA (‼️)

- ‼️ What is the anatomy of the thumb ligaments?
    - Saddle joint, and thus it is unstable, stabilized by 16 ligaments, of which main ones are:
    - 5 ligaments stabilising base of thumb
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2032.png)
        
    - 3 ligaments from MT base to Trapezium
        - **Anterior Oblique Ligment** [**Beak's** ligament] +
        - Posterior Oblique ligament (From base to Trapezium)
        - Dorsoradial ligament (from base to trapezium)
    - 2 ligaments to 2nd MT base
        - Anterior + posterior inter metacarpal ligament (from base to 2MT base)
- Pathophysiology of base of thumb OA?
    - Described by Pellegrini et al.
    - Due to attenuation of the AOL (Beak's ligament) ➔ Leads to loss of restraint to dorsal translation when flexing MCPJ ➔ joint incongruency with abnormal palmar forces (thats why destruction starts from palmar to dorsal)

- Clinical features?
    - History - 3 big - PAIN, STIFFNESS, DEFORMITY
    - **Shouldering** of the CMCJ - seen as prominence at base of thumb due to dorsal subluxation of the MC on the trapezium
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2034.png)

- ‼️ ⚠️ Classification of base of thumb OA?
    - **Eaton and Littler**
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2038.png)
        
    - Stage 1 = joint **widening** due to synovitis
    - 2 = **narrowing** of CMCJ, osteophytes < 2mm, **1/3** subluxation
    - 3 = marked narrowing, osteophytes >2mm, **> 1/3** subluxation
    - 4 = pantrapezial arthritis (STT involvement)
- What are the **management** options for Base of thumb OA?
    - Non op
        - Splinting
        - Steroid injection
    - Op - if fail conservative
        - Unstable with no OA = Recon of Beck ligament
        - OA Options
            - Trapeziectomy +/- LRTI +/- interposition +/- suspension
            - Fusion
            - Arthroplasty
    - If presence of thumb **MCPJ hyperextension**
        - Kwire is for some scarring and to allow some stiffening
- Surgical options?
    1. Beak's ligament reconstruction
    2. **MC extension osteotomy** - can be done at Eaton Littler 1
    3. Trapeziectomy alone
    - +/- adjuncts
        - Ligament Reconstruction Tendon interposition (LRTI) - **FCR** tendon is woven through base of thumb to reconstruct the Beak ligament
            
            ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2039.png)
            
        - Suspension with tight rope/ K-wire (most tight rope)
            - Purpose is to prevent metatarsal subsidence; however, no evidence that subsidence leads to poor outcomes
        - **Palmaris longus** interposition
    - Replacement (rare)
    - Fusion (for young manual workers)
        - Position 10° radial abduction, 30 ° palmar abduction for function
        - Need to warn of problem - cannot put hand in pocket
- What are the risks on trapeziectomy?
    - Early - SRN injury, confuse trapezium with scaphoid (check II)
    - Late - Subsidence of MC (however, studies show no correlation with clinical outcomes)

- Post op?
    - K-wiring at base, remove at 6/52
    - bulky dressing
    - 6/52 thumb spica splint
    - 3/12 back to usual hand function with less pain, 60-70% pinch strength
- What position for base of thumb fusion?
    - “cup holding position”
    - 10° radial abduction, 30 ° palmar abduction

- Evidence for various treatments for Base of thumb OA?
    - **Trapeziectomy alone** - **Cochrane review 2009** found trapeziectomy alone was a/w fewer complications than + LRTI with similar functional outcomes
    - Davis et al JHS 1997, Belcher JHS 2000 - No difference with interposition
    - Overall - Systematic review by Vermeulen 2011 found no surgical procedure is proven to be superior to another
        - Fusion not superior but found to have 8-20% non union risks

- What is the approach to the base of thumb?
    - 1. Wagner **Radiopalmar** approach
        - Plane = thenar muscles// APL (first extensor compartment)
        - Danger - SRN dorsal sensory nerve

        - Plane = Between **first and third** extensor compartments
        - I = straight incision between EPL and EPB
            
            ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%204.png)

### OA HAND

- What are the nodules known as?
    - DIPJ OA = Herbeden Nodes
    - PIPJ OA = Bouchard's Nodes
    
    ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2040.png)
    
- Assessment?
    - Confirm cyst with transillumination
    - Nail ridging - mucous cyst pressing on the germinal matrix ➔ nail ridging
    - Need TRO rheumaroid arthritis, psoriatic arhritis
- What is the management?
    - Non Op - 20-60% spontaneously resolve
- What are the indications of surgery?
    - impending rupture, infected
- What is the surgery? What considerations?
    - “Cyst excision, osteophyte resection KIV fusion”
    - Considerations - may need rotational flap for skin coverage if doing cyst excision
    - Other option is don’t do excision to avoid need for flap.
- What kind of flaps?
    - Zitelli Bilobed flap
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2041.png)
        
- Why need to resect dorsal osteophyte?
    - To try to prevent recurrence as increased dorsal joint space leads to one way valve.
- What are the options of fusion?
    - Headless compression screw best fusion rates
    - K-wires risk of pin track infection

### Rheumatoid Hand (‼️)

- How to describe RA Hand?
    - **Wrist** - caput ulna, **RADIAL** deviation
    - **Fingers** - boutonniere, swan neck, **ULNA** deviation
    - **Thumb** - Z shape (Boutonierres), gamekeeper, swan neck
    - **Tendon Ruptures** - dropped fingers (Vaugh Jackson Syndrome), Mannerfelt syndrome (FPL)
    - **Acute** inflammation - synovitis, swelling, erythema
    - **Nerve** - Median nerve
    - Check **function**
    - **Proximally** - elbow rheumatoid nodules
    - **Complete** - Lung for fibrosis, Eye for uveitis
    - Ddx - plaques for psoriasis
- Features in RA XR?
    
    ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - "Bilateral symmetrical involvement"
    - Erosions in MCP and PIPJ
    - "periarticular osteopenia, Uniform joint space loss, bone erosions, soft tissue swelling, joint subluxation, subchondral cysts”
    - Radial deviation of wrist, ulnar deviation of fingers at MCPJ
- In RA Hands, which joints to do first? Arms or legs first?
    - Principles will be big joint Lower limb replacement first
    - This is to allow the use of walking aids without disrupting the UL recon
- If multiple joints involved in hands which will you do first?
    - Proximal to distal
    - Address caput ulna to prevent future tendon ruptures
- ‼️ How does RA causes all these hand deformities?
    - This question is going specific into each hand deformity
    - Deposition of Immune complex → panus → synovitis → joints and tendon ruptures
        - [Ulnar Deviation] Disruption of RC ligaments → radial deviation of wrist → changes tendon pull on the digits ➔ ulnar deviation
        - [Swan neck] Synovitis at MCPJ volar ➔ **Volar** subluxations of MCPJ ➔ extensors overpowered ➔ PIPJ Volar plate attenuation ➔ hyperextension of PIPJ
        - [Boutonierre] Synovitis at central slip ➔ rupture of central slip at base of P2 ➔ Lateral slips sublux volarly
- What is Caput Ulna Deformity?
    - it is the **volar subluxation of the carpus** resulting in the prominent ulna head
- Management of Caput Ulna?
    - 2 options of Bony procedures:
    - **Resection** of distal ulna - Darrach's
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - **Arthrodesis** of DRUJ with proximal pseudoarthrosis- Suave Kapanji technique
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Caput Ulnar.pdf
- Ulna resection vs DRUJ Fusion?
    - **Resection Darrach's** (+) Easy; (-) Progression of ulna translation of carpus with further sliding
- What is Vaughan-jackson syndrome?
    - Disruption of digital extensor tendons, beginning on the ulnar side with the EDM ➔ sequential rupturing of EDC ➔ EIP
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- What is Mannerfelt syndrome?
    - Rupture of the FPL tendon caused by bony spur in carpal tunnel
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2012.png)
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2013.png)
        
- What is the management of mannerfelt syndrome?
    - Dependant on chronicity - if acute with fresh tendon edges - consider **bridge graft** e.g. Palmaris longus or FCR
    - if chronic and require **tendon transfer** ➔ FDS tendon
- How to approach "dropped Fingers"?
    - Can be due to PIN palsy or tendon rupture or sagittal band rupture (in RA - due to volar subluxation of MCPJ also) . Do 2 tests -
    - Check **tenodesis** test ➔ if positive = nerve problem or Sagittal band rupture
    - Check if fingers can **maintain extension** ➔ if positive = sagittal band rupture
    - Check for volar subluxation of MCPJ ➔ should be stiff and joints not reducible
- How do you manage dropped fingers due to tendon attrition?
    - Address primary pathophysiology of attrition. Darrach procedure to remove ulnar head (cause of ruptures)
    - Options:
        - 1. **EIP** to motor both EDM and ring finger
        - 2. EIP to motor EDM, long finger EDC side to side to EDC ring finger
        - 3. If insufficient tendons - PL and FDS tendons

### Boutonnieres (#❗️❗️ )

- What is Boutonniere deformity?
    - Rupture of central slip that attaches to base of P2 resulting in flexion of PIPJ and Hyperextension of DIPJ
- Causes?
    - Inflammatory - RA, psoriatric arthropathy
    - Traumatic - rupture of central slip
- ‼️ Pathophysiology of boutonnieres?
    
    ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    - 1. Central slip rupture due to trauma or inflammation (RA) ➔
    - 2. Attenuation of **dorsal** triangular ligaments holding the 2 lateral bands
    - 3. Lateral bands migrate volar ➔ causing PIPJ flexion and DIPJ extension
    - 4. Contracture of **volar** **transverse** retinacular ligaments and lumbricals on radial band ➔ fixed contracture
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2015.png)
        
- Clinical tests for **Boutonnieres**?
    - Elson’s test (acute) – extend PIPJ against resistance; check DIPJ
        - If loose, this means extension is by central slip
        - If stiff, this means central slip ruptured, compensated by lateral bands that attach to DIPJ
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2016.png)
        
    - Boyes test (chronic) – **Passively hyperextend PIPJ and assess DIPJ movement** [Like Elson's test if DIPJ is rigid, then positive test]
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2017.png)
        
        - If DIPJ is **rigidly extended and unable to be flexed**, this means central slip retracted with adjacent soft tissue contractures ➔ so the retracted central slip keeps pulling on the lateral bands to keep DIPJ extended.
    
    [Central slip rupture.pdf](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Central_slip_rupture.pdf)
    
- Classification of Boutonnieres?
    - Nalebuff - principle is fixed vs flexed
    - 1 = 15 deg extensor lag
    - 2 = 30-40 lag
    - 3 = **fixed** contracture with OA changes
- **Management** of Chronic Boutonniere? Special Splint?
    - 1 (Flexible) = **Capner** splint that keeps PIPJ extended
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2018.png)
        
    - 2 (Flexible)
        - Tenotomy of lateral bands and central tendon
        - Lateral band relocation and **Triangular ligament reconstruction**
        - Tendon reconstruction e.g. **Matev** procedure, FDS Slip transfer
    - 3 (Rigid) = PIPJ Arthrodesis (Presence of OA changes)
- What is the matev procedure?
    - One lateral band divided and sutured to remaining central slip
    - THe other lateral band crossed and suruted to opposite lateral band
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2019.png)
        
    - 
- How do you do FDS Slip transfer?
    - The FDS tendon is transferred from volar to dorsal through the lumbrical canal and sutured into the dorsally mobilized lateral bands
    
    [FDS transfer to lateral bands.pdf](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/FDS_transfer_to_lateral_bands.pdf)

    - It is a flexion contracture of the PIPJ
    - Slight hyperextension of the DIPJ
    - Radiological evidence of calcification at proximal attachment of volar plate of PIPJ
    - History of hyperextension injury at PIPJ
    - Also used to describe the Duputryen's disease flexion deformity at the PIPJ
        - "Prolonged flexion contracture of the PIP joint can lead to central slip attenuation, incompetence of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint volar plate, and volar subluxation of the lateral bands"

    - Hyperextension at PIPJ, flexion at DIPJ

- ‼️ Pathophysiology of swan neck?
    
    ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - **Primary Lesion:** Volar plate laxity at PIPJ ➔ hyperextension of PIPJ by central slip ➔ **FDP** pulls DIPJ flexed ➔ Attenuation of the transverse retinacular ligament on volar side ➔ **Lateral bands** sublux dorsally and worsen hyperextension
    - **Secondary Lesion** leads to imbalance of forces on PIPJ with PIPJ extension forces greater than PIPJ forces
        - [MCPJ] **volar** subluxation in RA due to synovitis
        - [PIPJ] **FDS** rupture ➔ unopposed PIPJ extension with subsequent attenuation of transverse retinacular ligaments
        - [DIPJ] **Mallet** injury ➔ due to attrition of terminal tendon, extension forces now go thru central slip that attaches to base of middle phalanx, **leading to hyperextension at PIPJ**
- What are the causes?
    - Inflammatory - RA, psoriatric arthropathy
    - Traumatic - mallet finger
- Classification of swan neck deformity?
    - Nalebuff [essential principle is fixed vs flexible]
    - 1 = FROM, no intrinsic tightness
    - intrinsic tightness
    - 3 = cannot be corrected
    - 4 = Severe OA

- Clinical test for Swan Neck/ intrinsic plus deformity?
    - Bunnell test - to assess for joint stiffness
- What is the Bunnell's test?
    
    
    <aside>
    💡 What are the 3 special hand tests?
    
    **Bunnell**/ Swan neck/ intrinsic tightness /Passive/ flex MCPJ/ check PIPJ ROM
    **If better** = positive = intrinsic tightness
    **If not** = negative = capsular tightness; will not benefit from balancing procedures
    
    **Boyes**/ Boutonierre/ Passive/ Extend PIPJ/ check DIPJ ROM
    If better = flexible = can do balancing procedures
    If not = capsular tightness 
    
    **Bouvier/** Claw/ Passive/ Flex MCPJ/ See if claw straightens out
    if straightens = Zancolli capsulodesis
    if not but flexible = need Zancolli lasso
    if rigid and fixed = joint tightness
    
    </aside>
    
    - Bunnell´s test is a **passive** test, that evaluates the presence of intrinsic muscle tightness by comparing the range of motion and force needed to passively flex the proximal interphalangeal joints while the MCP joints are passively extended and flexed. It also helps determine if tightness is secondary to extrinsic muscle contracture or interphalangeal capsule adhesions.
    - If MCPJ flexed and PIPJ cannot flex better = due to capsule adhesions and soft tissue procedures will not work.
    - If MCPJ flexed and PIPJ can flex better = intrinsic tightness with no capsule adhesions

### Intrinsic Plus Deformity

- What is intrinsic plus deformity due to?
    - Intrinsic tightness and deficient extrinsic muscles
    - Flexed MCPJ and PIPJ extended (actions of lumbricals)

### Lumbrical plus Finger

- What is lumbrical plus finger?
    - Paradoxical extension of the IPJ while attempting to flex the fingers (may not fully extend, but appear to be less flexed)
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2042.png)

- Pathoanatomy of lumbrical plus finger?
    - FDP 3, 4, 5 fingers share common muscle belly
    - When FDP is disrupted distal to the origin of the lumbricals, and flexion is attempted, **proximal stump of FDP will pull on the lumbricals**
    - Lumbricals, pulling on the lateral bands leads to PIPJ and DIPJ extension of the involved digit
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2043.png)
        
- Management of lumbrical plus finger?

### Intrinsic Minus Claw hand

- Causes of intrinsic minus claw hand?
    - Vascular cause - Volkmann's Ischemic contracture
    - Neuro cause - Brachial Plexus Injury involving C7/ T1
- Pathoanatomy of Intrinsic minus hand?
    - Strong extrinsic muscles/ extrinsic contracture (flexion > extension), deficient intrinsic muscles (loss of lumbricals)

### Kienbock’s (‼️)

![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2045.png)

- What is Kienbock? What is the pathophysiology?
    - **AVN** of lunate
    - 2 main Theories:
        - **Mechanical - Negative ulnar variance** ➔ more load to lunate (this is uncertain as studies show many patients with Kienbock have neutral or positive UV
            - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26686062/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26686062/)
        - **Blood supply to lunate** (YIX pattern; I pattern high risk). I pattern is the only one with a single vessel.
            
            ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2046.png)
            
- Risk factors for Kienbock?
    - **Anatomical** - negative ulnar variance, blood supply, **Zapico** lunate morphology
        
        ![Untitled](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399/Untitled%2047.png)
        
    - **Patient** - Same as risk factors for AVN in general
    - ‼️ Risk factors/ Causes of AVN? (Hip, Kienbock)
        - Most common causes up to 90% reported - are associated with alchohol and steroids
        - **Idiopathic**
        - **Secondary** -
            - **intravascular** factors -
                - Systemic disease
                    - SLE causing vasculitis and venous outflow issues ➔ increased intraosseous pressure
                    - Sicke cell anemia ➔ abnormal shaped RBC obstruct blood flow
                    - Radiation ➔ vasculitis
                    - Hyperlipidmia, Alchohol ➔ theorized to increase lipid levels
                - Caisson's decompression disease (release of nitrogen gas bubbles into body)
            - Extra-vascular causes -
                - INTRAOSSEOUS
                    - Steroids leading to fat hypertrophy and increased intraooseous pressure
                - EXTRAOSSEOUS
                    - Trauma disrupting blood supply - NOF #, talus #
                    - Tamponade of blood supply - compressive causes

    - **Dorsal Radiocarpal** arch DRC
    - **Palmar Intercarpal** Arch PIC
- Clinical features of Kienbock?
    - Dorsal wrist pain
    - **"Radiological findings do not correlate with clinical findings"** severe changes may not have pain.
- What do you look for on XR?
    - AP - carpal collapse
    - Lateral - scaphoid flexion via scapholunate angle > 60 °
- How do you evaluate carpal collapse?
    - **Youm's Index** can be calculated from PA Hand XR
    - Carpal height / MC3 height
    - Normal is 0.51 to 0.57

        - **Core Decompression**
            - Distal radius metaphyseal core decompression
            - Effect if not caused by unloading of the radius surface
            - Instead, hypothesis is that osseous procedures close to the lunate generates a **regional vascular response** around the carpus.
