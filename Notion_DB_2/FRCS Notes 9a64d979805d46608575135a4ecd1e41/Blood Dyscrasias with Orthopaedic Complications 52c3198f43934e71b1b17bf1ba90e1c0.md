## Sickle Cell Anemia

- What is the inheritance of sickle cell disease?
    - Autosomal recessive
- What is sickle cell disease?
    - Hemoglobinopathy due to abnormal synthesis of Beta Globulin chain leading to defective hemoglobin
    - When there is drop in oxygen tensions ➔ RBC becomes sickle shaped
    - Babies are protected in first 6 months due to fetal Hb
- What orthopaedic manifestation of sickle cell anemia?
    - Sponateous femoral head **AVN** (30%)
    - Dactylitis - vaso-occlusive episodes in fingers
    - Bone infarcts
    - Osteopenic vertebral body with "fish" vertebrae ➔ kyphotic collapse
    - Long bone fractures with deformities

## Hemophilia

- What are the types of Haemophilia?
    - 3 main types
    - **Hemophilia A** - Factor **8** deficiency (**X-link recessive**)
    - **Hemophilia B** (aka Christmas disease) = Factor **9** deficiency (**X-link recessive**)
    - **von-Willebrand’s disease** = abnormal Factor 8 **(AD)**
- What are the orthopaedic manifestations of hemophilia?
    - Spontaneous hemathrosis ➔ synovitis ➔ haemophilic arthropathy
    - Sponatneous Muscle bleeds - pseudotumor
    - Generalized fracture risk due to osteopenia
- Whats the pathogenesis of Haemophiliac arthropathy?
    - Bleeding in joint ➔ Hemophilic synovitis (inflammation, angiogenesis, fibrosis) ➔ Hemophilic arthropathy (cartilage + bone destruction)
    - Full thickness erosions progress rapidly usually by late adolescence.
- Classification of Haemophiliac Arthropathy?
    - Modified Arnold Hilgartner XR Classifx
    - Grade 1 = Soft tissue fullness indicating effusion
    - 2 = Normal joint space, widened epiphysis, surface erosions
    - 3 = reduced joint space, subchondral cysts, sclerosis
    - 4 = Loss of joint space, extensive erosions, subluxations

- Commonly involved joints?
    - Joint involvement: Knee > Elbow > Ankle
- Early management of Haemophiliac Arthropathy?
    - Early = **Goal is to prevent/ delay OA**
    - Treat aggressively with aspiration, splinting.
    - Intra-articular steroid injections
    - Surgery = Open/ arthroscopic/ Radioisotope (Yttrium-90) **Synovectomy** can be considered if no arthropathy but painful.
- How will you do a TKR for this patient with Haemophiliac Arthropathy?
    - Preop -
        - MDT. avoid NSAIDS for 1 week, ensure factor levels adequate
        - Assessment - angular deformities, subluxations with instability, patellar erosion to a thin wafer, bone loss from erosions
        - Assess other infection - **HIV, HCV** (in the past before blood donor screening)
        - Soft tissue contractures
    - Intraop
        - Approach - due to arthrofibrosis, may stiff, requiring extensive release. Stand by extensile manoeuvres e.g. TT osteotomy
        - Patellar replacement - literature recommend routine replacement if sufficient thickness
        - Quadriceps lengthening if limited flexion
        - Meticulous hemostasis, topical TXA
    - Post op -
        - Consider no DVT prophylaxis due to bleeding risk; but begin early mobilisation, calf pumps
        - 3-5 day of Abx prophylaxis due to higher infection risk
- Unique complications of hemophilic arthroplasty TKR?
    - Infection risk - higher in hemophilia (up to 17% in literature vs 1-2%)

## Fanconi Anemia

- What is Fanconi Anemia?
    - Rare disease
    - AR condition
- Associated conditions?
    - Hypoplastic thumb, Radial Club hand
    - Polydactyly

## Thrombocytopenia Absent Radius (TAR)

- What is TAR?
    - Congenital malformation syndrome characterised by **bilateral** absence of radii and thrombocytopenia
    - Thrombocytopenia my lead to GIT bleeding, Intracranial bleed.
- Associated conditions?
    - Radial Club Hand, hypoplastic thumb
