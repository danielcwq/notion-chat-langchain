- What is osteoporosis?
    - It is a **progressive** **systemic** skeletal disease characterised by **normal mineralization** but **reduce density**
    - Defined by WHO as T score < -2.5 (race and sex matched young adult)
- What is difference between T and Z score?
    - T score is race and sex matched, age is 25-35 year old adults
    - Z score is race, sex and **AGE matched**
    - Z score is useful to diagnose secondary osteporosis
- ‼️ T-score - draw normal distribution curve. tell me what you mean < 2.5?
    - 68-95-99.7 (1SD-2Sd-3SD)
    - 2SD = 95%, 2.5SD ~98.8%
    - So is < 2.5SD, it means 0.62%

- ‼️ Classification of osteoporosis?
    - **Primary**
        - Type 1 (post menopausal) - mainly **cancellous** loss, higher bone turn over
        - Type 2 (senile, age related) - both **cortical and cancellous** loss
    - **Secondary** – Role of the Z score ➔ due to steroids, endocrine
        - Z score is BMD relative to similar aged patients
        - If Z score < -2.0; there is risk of secondary causes (“even compared to same age ppl, bone is lousy”)
- ‼️ What is FRAX score?
    - It is a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool developed by University of Sheffield
    - It is a score to **calculate 10 year probability of fracture** - hip fractures and major osteoporotic fracture (wrist, shoulder, hip, spine)
    - It has a calculator looking at age, alcohol consumption, femoral neck BMD, weight, height, smoking, steroid use
    - Stratify into low, intermediate or high risks
        - < 10% risk per year
        - 10-20%
        - 20%
- What is DEXA scan?
    - Dual Energy XR Absorptiometry
    - Machine that produce two different XR beams of different energies that are absorbed in different proportions by bone and soft tissue
- Which T-score do you look at Lumbar spine or Femoral neck?
    - Based on the FRAX score, it only looks at the **femoral neck** T score
    - “There is more data available for this skeletal site”

- What causes false positive and false negatives of T score?
    - **False Negative (bone density better than it is)** - Conditions that cause sclerosis or increased localised bone deposition
        - Degenerative changes a spine or hip, healed fractures, avascular necrosis, benign or metastatic bone forming lesions
        - Metal implants increase “bone density”
            - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/)
    - **False positive (bone density lower than it is)** - Conditions that cause removal of local bone
        - laminectomy defects and lytic lesions spina bifida
            - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/)
    - This is the reason why they provide the images - to look for possibility of false positives or negatives
- Can you diagnose Osteoporosis with CT scan?
    - Oppurtunistic screening has been described to be able to be done with abdominal CT scans of patients
    - CT attenuation measured in Hounsfield Units (HU) are lower in osteoporosis (Less bone to attenuate Radiation)
        - CT-attenuation values were significantly lower at all vertebral levels for patients with DXA-defined osteoporosis (P < 0.001). An L1 CT-attenuation threshold of 160 HU or less was 90% sensitive and a threshold of 110 HU was more than 90% specific for distinguishing osteoporosis from osteopenia and normal BMD.
    - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736840/#:~:text=CT%2Dattenuation%20values%20were%20significantly,from%20osteopenia%20and%20normal%20BMD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736840/#:~:text=CT%2Dattenuation%20values%20were%20significantly,from%20osteopenia%20and%20normal%20BMD).
- What is the Singh index?
    - It is looking at the trabecular lines, diving into 6 grades depending on which lines re not present
    - Trabecular groups of the proximal Femur
        - There are 5 trabecular groups -
        - Ward's triangle is the confluence of these groups, which is an area of weakness where fracture can propagate.

- What are bisphosphonates?
    - Antiresorptive medication that inhibits osteoclastic activity depending on nitrogenous or non-nitrogenous type
    - **Nitrogenous type (more common)** directly inhibits osteoclastic action by inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase enzymes in the mevalonate cholestrol pathway **,** inhibits **brush border**
        - E.g. Alendronate (Fosamax), Risedronate (Actonel), Zoledronate (Aclasta)
    - **Non-nitrogenous type** - induces apoptosis of the osteoclasts
    - Cx - Jaw osteonecrosis , GERD , AFF
- When do you order a BMD scan?
    - Based on the National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group, endorsed by NICE guidelines in 2022 ([https://www.nogg.org.uk/full-guideline/summary-main-recommendations](https://www.nogg.org.uk/full-guideline/summary-main-recommendations))
    1. FRAX score shows intermediate or high fracture risk 
    2. After osteoporotic fracture
- When do you start bisphosphonates?
    - Based on the National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group, endorsed by NICE guidelines in 2022 ([https://www.nogg.org.uk/full-guideline/summary-main-recommendations](https://www.nogg.org.uk/full-guideline/summary-main-recommendations))
    1. Based on FRAX score - Use **FRAX score (can exclude entering BMD levels) - if 10 year risk of major osteoporotic # > 20%**
    2.  - A minimal trauma fracture of the **hip or spine i**n a person older than 50 years of age is presumptive of osteoporosis. 
        - Treatment may be initiated without confirmation of low bone mineral density (BMD).
    3. Post menopausal women, age > 50 treated with **oral stroids** > 7.5mg/day prednisolone for next 3 months, can start bone protective treatment at same time. 
    - Use BMD to guide management after fracture at other sites.
- What are the guidelines for bisphosphonates use?
    - NUH Guidelines

    - Prior to starting, check renal function, history of GERD
    - There are **no consensus on the duration** of Bisphosphonates or when or duration of drug holiday
    - Based on the **NICE NOGG guidelines** ([https://www.nogg.org.uk/full-guideline/summary-main-recommendations](https://www.nogg.org.uk/full-guideline/summary-main-recommendations))
        - Recommend temporary treatment pause of 18 to 36 months after 5 year of oral bisphosphonates
    - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707342/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707342/)
- What is Strontium?
    - Similar to calcium. Increases bone formation and decrease bone resorption
    - Risk of DVT and serious allergies. Restricted to those whom cannot tolerate bisphosphonates
- ‼️ ⚠️What other antiresoptives?
    - **RANKL inhibitor = Denusomab (Prolia)**
        - Anti Resorptive; Binds to RANKL receptor (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B) receptor and thus prevents maturation of pre-osteoclasts into osteoclasts
        - Once every **6 months injection**
        - Other Uses - multiple myeloma, GCT
    - **Teriparatide (Forteo) Recombinant** PTH. Intermittent exposure to PTH paradoxically **activates osteoblasts** more than osteoclasts
        - Delivery: SC 20ml/**day**
- What are daily calcium requirements?
    - For people more than 50 years old
    - Calcium 1200 - 1500mg/day
    - Vit D 800 - 1000IU/day
    - Practically,
        - Calcium + Vit D 1 tab OM
        - If Vit D also low 20-30 --> add Lynae (Cholecalciferol/ Vitamin D3)
        - If Vit D < 20 ➔ Add 50,000U / Week Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) x 8/52 ➔ Then 1000U Cholecalciferol after ➔ Start Bisphosphonates once Vit D >20

- What are AFF? How does Bisphosphonates cause AFF?
    - Evidence suggests that AFF are stress fractures.
    - There is generalized supression of bone **remodelling** due to bisphosphonates.
    - And because remodelling action localizes at areas developing stress fractures, thus affect adversely the intracortical repair of developing stress fractures

## OSTEOMALACIA (#❌ )

- What is difference from osteoporosis?
    - Compared to Osteoporosis, there is **deficiency in mineralisation**  (NORMAL STRUCTURE/ OSTEOID, ABNORMAL MINERALIZATION)
- Etiology of osteomalacia?
    - Etiology = vit D deficiency
    - 1° from nutritional deficit
    - 2° to **renal failure**, Rickets (Vit D resistant/ Vit D dependant/ nutritional)
- Draw the different stress strain curve for Osteopetrosis, vs osteoporosis vs Normal bone?
    
    ![Untitled](7%20Osteoporosis%20Osteomalacia%203e67370dffe4434684b67dc755d5ffae/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - Osteomalacia makes bone **less stiff** (lower young modulus) and **more ductile** (longer plastic deformation phase)
    - Osteopetrosis makes bone **stiff** (higher young modulus) and **more brittle** (short plastic deformation phase)
- ‼️ XR features of osteomalacia?
    - Varus deformity due to recurrent stress fractures and healing
    - **Milkman Lines** aka **Loosers zones** aka **Pseudofractures** - Wide, transverse lucencies with sclerotic borders traversing partway through a bone, usually perpendicular to the involved cortex
        - (looks like AFF black line on proximal femur)
        - BUT IN MEDIAL CORTEX as opposed to lateral cortex in AFF
