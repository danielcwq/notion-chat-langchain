- What are the types of spondylolisthesis?
    - **Wiltse Newman Classifx**
    - Type 1 = Dysplasic
    - 2 = Isthmic = (2a) Lytic/ (2b) Elongation/ (2c)Acute #
    - 3 = degeneration
    - 4 = Traumatic other than Pars
    - 5 = Pathological
- How to classify severity?
    - Myerding - every 25% is 1 grade

- What is low grade vs high grade?
    - Literature consensus < 30% is low grade
- How can you investigate ?
    - XR - AP, Lateral; Flex/ Extend views – 4mm/ 10 deg translation for dyanamic instability
        - Can measure slip angle (more for isthmic)
    - MRI (add contrast whole spine if tumour)
- What are the features of dynamic instability?
    - XR - Angular 10 ° or translation 4mm
    - MRI - Facet fluid sign

- How to measure slip angle?
    - Many ways to measure
    - L5/ S1 Slip angle
        - I will measure based on the Lovell and Winter's method
        - Line perpendicular to posterior sacrum line
        - Line along L5 inferior endplate
        
        ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - L4/5 Slip angle
        - Measure from Superior endplate of L5 and inferior end plate of L4
            
            ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%203.png)
            
- What is the association of Listhesis with pelvic incidence, Sacral slope or Pelvic tilt?
    - Labelle 2004. found that **increase PI, SS and PT** is **associated** with Spondylolisthesis
    - E.g. Pelvic incidence. Population mean is **51 °**; those with listhesis is **71 °**
    - Pelvic incidence not able to predict slip progression
- Is reduction necessary?
    - Controversial
    - Theoretical advantage of Reduction = larger surface area for union, global sagittal alignment correction
    - But risk of nerve injury if reduce - 30%.
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the benefits of reduction?
    - Restore **balance**
    - Increased **surface area** for fusion
    - Indirect **decompression** of foramen
    - **Less tensile stress** on implant
- ‼️ At which stage of reduction is nerve injury the highest?
    - Based on anatomic studies by Petraco et al., 29% of nerve root strain occurs in first 50% of reduction, and 71% in the **second half of reduction**
    - The higher the slip angle, the higher the risk of nerve injury in reduction.
    - Paper reccomend correction of angular deformity with only partial reduction of translational deformity may provide the benefits while minimizing L5 nerve root injury

### DYSPLASTIC (Wiltz **TYPE 1)**

![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%204.png)

- ‼️ What are XR features of dysplastic spondylolisthesis?
    - **Rounded** S1 (sacral doming), **Trapezoidal** L5 vertebral body
    - Small **transverse** processes
    - **Posterior elements** dysplasia
    - Sacral dysplasia and kyphosis
    - Look for associated elongated Pars or pars lysis
    - **Watch for. - spina bifida! (see a hole)**
        
        ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%205.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%206.png)
        
- How will you approach this patient?
    - Hx - symptoms
    - PE - looking for spina bifida, gait, hamstring spasm
- ‼️ What do they present with? What special gait?
    - L5 radiculopathy
        - **1. Hamstring spasm,**
        - **2. Increased pelvic tilt (hamstring pull it down) retroverted pelvis,**
        - **3. hyperlordosis**
    - **Phalen-dickson gait** (waddling, crouched gait with knee and hip flexion)
    
    ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%207.png)
    
- How to classify dysplastic spondylolisthesis?
    - Marchetti-Bartolozzi Subclassification
    
    ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - High Dysplastic vs Low dysplastic form
    - (From SOA)
    
    ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%209.png)
    
- Management of dysplastic spondylolisthesis?
    - Low grade ➔ **Insitu** fusion
        - Tay KS et al. 2016 no difference with reduction at 5 year f/u
    - High grade ➔ **Fusion** KIV **reduction** (will need to cut the Dome to help with reduction and interbody fusion)
        - Consider if global sagittal imbalance

### ISTHMIC (Wiltz **TYPE 2)**

![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%2010.png)

- What is the typical patient?
    - Children and young and adults
    - a/w ethnicity - Eskimos ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3962638/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3962638/))
- What are the subtypes of Isthmic Spondylolisthesis?
    - 2a - Stress fracture - **spondylolysis**
    - 2b - Elongation
    - 2c - Acute frature
- Mechanism of injury?
    - Repetitive Hyperextension
- ‼️ What are the risk factors of progression?
    - **Patient** – female, young, symptomatic
    - **Disease** factors – **Slip angle > 10**, **high** grade, **dysplasic** features (Dome S1, trapezoidal L5, Spina bifida), **High PI > 50 deg**
- Which location most common?
    - L5/S1
- ‼️ Difference in neurology compared to degenerative spondylolisthesis? If radiculopathy present what is causing it?
    - Because the lamina is still posterior placed while only the VB translates anteriorly; so central and lateral recess stenosis less common than forminal stenosis
    - i.e. L5/S1 degenerative listhesis will usually involve **traversing nerve root S1** while **isthmic listhesis will affect exiting root L5**
    - If there is radiculopathy, 2 broad categories
        - **Non spondylolytic** - presence of herniated disc. Stress in disc adjacent to lysis can lead to herniation
        - **Spondylolytic** - Osteophytes around lysis, edema and hematoma compression
    - Types of radiculopathy in spondylolysis

- What is the step you feel in the patient’s back if this is a L4/5 Spondylo**lysis?**
    - You will feel the L4 Spinous process. This is because the L4 Vertebral body slips forwards but the spinous process remains at the back!
    - This is as opposed to a degenerative L4/5 Slip. What one will feel is the L5 instead.
        
        ![Untitled](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- Why is there pain in extension?
    - **IAP abuts the pars lysis area**
- What is listhesis crisis?
    - Severe back pain aggravated by extension and relieved by rest
    - a/w severe hamstring spasm and neurologic deficit
- What investigation?
    - SPECT (Single photon emission CT) ➔ if hot means good potential for healing
- Indications for Pars repair?
    - Young, No listhesis, Stable, No neurology, No facet OA
- Stable, Unilateral Lysis - how will you manage? Outcomes?
    - **Non operative** - PT, hamstring stretch, analgesia
    - Debnath et al. Spine 2007
    - 42 patients with unilateral spondylosis, HOT on scan, 6/12 non op ➔ 81% avoided surgery. Remainder confirmed non union and underwent ORIF
    - Bracing is controversial
- Stable, Bilateral Lysis - management?
    - Similar to unilateral - **non operative**
- Stable lysis but Persistent symptoms? what will you do?
    - Unilateral = ORIF with screw
    - Bilateral = Pedicle screw with laminar hook
- How will you manage **unstable** Spondylolysis?
    - Unstable = need fusion
    - Low grade = In-situ fusion
    - High grade = Reduction and Fusion
- What is the principle of lysis repair?
    - Goal = anatomical and rigid fixation
    1. **Resect** fibrocartilignous tissue at lysis
    2. **Freshen** bone edges
    3. Iliac crest bone **graft** from PSIS
    4. Pars-interarticularis lag **screw** + laminar hook
- What if associated with spina bifida?
    - Expect abnormal posterior arch, thus need to recreate arch with hardware
    - Increased risk of neurological injury
- Why L5 nerve root irritation?
    - Fibrous healing at pars defect
    - Loss of disc height ➔ foraminal disc
    - Resulting in irritation of exiting nerve root

### DEGENERATIVE (**TYPE 3)**

- Most common segment?
    - L4/5 ➔ usually L5 radiculopathy (affects traversing nerve root)
- What are the indications for surgery?
    - NID - neurology, instability, Disability
- If non op fail how will you treat?
    - **In low grade slip < 30% [may not need to fuse]**, no consensus between decompression only, decompression + PLF, decompression + PLIF
        - Studies show decompression ONLY for low grade EVEN WITH INSTABILITY have good results
        
        [Decom without fusion for low grae.pdf](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Decom_without_fusion_for_low_grae.pdf)
        
        [Decomp only vs PLF vs instrumented.pdf](Spondylolisthesis%20508b71b763744dbd95cb2c83ef851472/Decomp_only_vs_PLF_vs_instrumented.pdf)
        
    - In **high grade slip > 30% [should fuse] ,** no consensus between insitu fusion vs reduction and fusion
        - Reduction theoretically increases surface area for fusion, and correct global spinal alignment BUT risk of nerve root injury
        - But recent systematic review show no difference in fusion rates for insitu vs reduction and no difference in outcomes
        - Consider reduction if high slip angle > 45 °, severe sagittal imbalance, increased risk of pseudoarthrosis
- Evidence for decompression alone or decompression + fusion?
    - No consensus if fusion is necessary in degenerative spondylolisthesis even in dynamic instability.
    - Aware of 2021 NEJM study by **Austevoll et al. Multicenter RCT** that included cases with **dynamic instability** found that no fusion was non inferior to instrumented fusion over a period of 2 years.

- What do you know about the SPORT trial?
    - Stand for: Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial
    - A multicenter RCT over 13 centers; comparing op vs Non op for **Spinal stenosis with and without Spondylolisthesis** involving patients published in NEJM 2008 and JBJS in 2009
    - "Found that when undergo as treated analysis, Surgery gave better outcomes for both conditions"
    - "Aware of criticisms - high loss to follow up (64% left), high cross over rates, no standardized surgery (fuse or no fuse) or non op"
    - **Results - Spinal Stenosis without Listhesis**
        - Surgery is decompressive laminectomy only
        - Intention to treat analysis – no difference
        - As treated Analysis – surgery better for all outcomes
        - SPORT no listhesis.pdf
    - **Results - SS with Spondylolisthesis**
        - Intention to treat analysis – no difference
        - As treated analysis – Surgery better than non op at 2 year and 4 year
        - SPORT with listhesis.pdf
    - **Results for discectomy**
        - High cross over - 50% of those to surgery did not have surgery, 30% of non op received surgery
        - ITT analysis - no difference
        - ATT - Surgery greater improvement in outcome measures for 4 and 8 years
    - Criticisms of SPORT trial
        - **No consistent surgical mx** as it can be decompression alone, + fusion or even instrumentation (for spondylolisthesis)
        - No specific protocol for non Op mx
        - **Very high cross over** rates. Only 33% randomized to op underwent op; 43% randomized to non-op underwent op!
        - **High drop out rate with only 64% remaining** at 8 year mark
- What is the role of PT for spondylolisthesis?
    - **Symptom relief** ➔ massage, manipulations, traction, electrical stimulation, interferential therapy
    - **Secondary prevention** → core muscle strengthening
