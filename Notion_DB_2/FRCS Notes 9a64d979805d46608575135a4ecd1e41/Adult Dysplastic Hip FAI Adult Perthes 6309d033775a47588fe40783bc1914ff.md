## Adult Dysplastic Hip

- What are the abnormalities? - Acetab, femur, Soft tissue
    - Acetbulum - **retroverted**, shallow
    - Femur ‚Äì **anteverted** (more LT) , coxa **valga** (high neck shaft angle), coxa **magna** (big head), **plana,** small canal, small head
    - Soft tissue - thickened capsule, contracted iliopsoas, adductors and hamstirings, shortened sciatic nerve,
- Other causes other than DDH?
    - For acetabulum to develop, need a concentric force. So any condition that reduces that leads to dysplasia
    - Polio, cerebral palsy, hyperlaxity, **perthe's** disease can cause a dysplastic hip
- What are the XR features?
    - **Acetablum** shallow with a higher acetabular index/ angle of sharp
    - **Femur head** - coxa magna (large head), not speherical, does not articulate in acetablum, small, disrupted shenton line
    - **Femur neck** - High neck shaft angle, (valgus)
    - **Femur** - small canal, anteverted with with LT exposed
- How do you assess this patient with Adult Dysplastic Hip?
    - **triple assessment**
    - Hx = PMHx of DDH polio, perthes, cerebral palsy, function, pain
    - PE
        - Inspection
        - Gait, special tests - **trendelenberg**
        - LLD
        - Stiffness, THomas's test
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è How do you classify Adult dysplastic Hip?
    - Hartofilakidis ‚Äì **A**/ **B** (false acetab with some articulation with true acetab))/ **C** (no articulation with true acetab)

    - Crowe
        - Measure subluxation ‚Äì which requires normal femoral head diameter
        - Measure proximal migration ‚Äì Inter tear drop line to head neck junction/ Pelvic vertical height - <10%, 10-15%, 15-20%, > 20%

- What are the XR angles for Adult Dysplastic Hip/ Pincer FAI?
    - High **Acetabular Angle of Sharp** [33-37] = (Tear drop line \/ lateral sourcil) [different from acetabular index in paeds)
        
        ![Untitled](Adult%20Dysplastic%20Hip%20FAI%20Adult%20Perthes%206309d033775a47588fe40783bc1914ff/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - **Lateral CEA** [20-30 deg](vertical from center of head \/ lateral sourcil) - only applicable if head is enlocated..
        - Too small = DDH, Too big - FAI
        
        ![Untitled](Adult%20Dysplastic%20Hip%20FAI%20Adult%20Perthes%206309d033775a47588fe40783bc1914ff/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - **Tonnis Angle [<10]** (medial edge of sclerotic acetbuluar sourcil \/ lateral sourcil) - only if enlocated
        
        ![Untitled](Adult%20Dysplastic%20Hip%20FAI%20Adult%20Perthes%206309d033775a47588fe40783bc1914ff/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - **Anterior CE angle [> 20]** = need **false profile view**
        - Which is pelvis rotated 65 ¬∞ to XR with foot parallel to plate
        
        ![Untitled](Adult%20Dysplastic%20Hip%20FAI%20Adult%20Perthes%206309d033775a47588fe40783bc1914ff/Untitled%205.png)
        
- What are the XR signs of Acetabular retroversion?
    1. cross over sign (anterior wall cross posterior wall), 
    2. visible ischial spine sign

- What investigation for preop planning?
    - CT + 3D recon
- **Management** for Young, No OA Dysplastic Hip?
    - = Hip preserving ‚ûî depends on joint congruity
    - Hip congruent = Arthroscopy ‚Äì for very mild dysplasia
        - Predictors of failure ‚Äì LCEA < 15, tonnis > 20, broken shenton line (Ajay Shah et al.)
    - Hip not congruent = achieve coverage with Osteotomies to prevent OA
        - Reorientation **Bernese Periacetabular Osteotomy (PAO)**
        - KIV Proximal femoral osteotomy (PFO)
        - KIV Salvage Osteotomies
- **Management** for Elderly with OA Dysplastic Hip?
    - = Arthroplasty.
    - Crowe 1 = normal Hip COR
    - Crowe 2/3 = normal/ high/ medialization
    - Crowe 4 = likely need shortening
- What will be your implant choice in DDH?
    - Uncemented cup - cemented higher incidence of loosening
    - Cemented stem to allow adjustment of anteversion
    - Size of stem ‚Äì stand by small stem due to narrow canal
    - However, if for **subtrochanteric osteotomy ‚ûî Extensively coated, uncemented** long stems that can bypass the osteotomy site by 2 cortical diameters
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Considerations in Arthroplasty "How will you manage this Crowe 2/3 hip"? [Revised]**
    - Complex primary - pre, intra and post-op with Considerations divided into acetabular side and femoral side
        - Acetabulum  (3)
            - Hip center - native vs high
                - Aware downsides of high hip center - increased shear forces, smaller cup
                - Thus will strive to restore native hip center
            - Challenges in restoring as anatomy is altered
                - Need to look for TAL as a guide
            - Consider lateral augmentation
                - Aware that initial fixation is by anterior and posterior columns, but will want at least 65% coverage. if not, will need augmentation
                    - Femoral head autograft (screws)
                    - Metallic augments
        - Femur (2)
            - Dysplastic small, narrow, anteverted
                - Best for **cemented** implants with DDH stems to help with this
            - Consider **osteotomy** if need to move > 4cm
                - Options subtrochanteric vs trochanteric by Paavilenan
                - I am more familiar with subtrochanteric ‚ûî if so, use bone as **onlay** graft
                - If this is done, i will then need **uncemented** implants [decision is made pre op on the amount of distal translation needed]
                
                ![Untitled](Adult%20Dysplastic%20Hip%20FAI%20Adult%20Perthes%206309d033775a47588fe40783bc1914ff/Untitled%207.png)
                
            - 
        - Post op need to check Sciatic nerve after downwrd shift.
- What are the types of femoral shortening osteotomy?
    - **Subtrochanteric** osteotomy (most commonly done)
    - **Trochanteric** osteotomy described by Paavilainen

- When do you need lateral augmentation?
    - usually no need as long as **~65%** of the hemispherical cup is covered.
    - Initial stability provided by anterior and posterior columns, not the roof anyway
- What are the arguments for for high vs native hip center?
    - Controversial but consensus is for restoration if possible
        - High Hip + : no need subtroch osteotomy, no need bone graft, less risk of sciatic nerve problems with lenghtening
        - High Hip ‚Äì : **Small** cup size (smaller primary arc range), **LLD** with abnormal hip mechanics with **persistent** limp, higher **shear** forces
    - Biomechanical studies shows lower loading force in normal hip center and increase in loading for lateralization and proximalization of hip center (Bicanic et al. 2009)
    - If unable to, then opt for high hip center
        - (Advantage is that no risk of sciatic nerve problems related with lengthening, but poorer bone stock + shortened)
- How do you achieve a native hip center?
    - This can be achieved by medialization, structural allograft for lateral augmentation.

- Curious - after you bring hip down and shorten the hip, wouldn‚Äôt the femur be shorter?
    - Yes it is shorter than the original. But it will still be longer than before the op because you shorten less than you bring the hip down‚Ä¶

## FAI

- What are the 2 types of FAI? and their etiology?
    - Cam = femoral based lesion
        - Cam ‚Äì idiopathic or secondary from perthes (magna), SCFE, trauma
    - Pincer = acetabulum based
        - Pincer ‚Äì Idiopathic or DDH with acetabulum retroversion, traumatic, iatrogenic
- Clinical features of FAI?
    - Pain on limits of ROM
    - FADIR - anterior impingement
    - FABER - posterior impingement

    - **1. Make sure pelvic XR are central**
        - Check obturator foramen equal
        - Iliococcyx line is inline with symphysis pubis (
        - Check pelvic tilt - coccyx should be 2-3cm from symphysis pubis
    - 2. Features of Acetabular Retroversion
        - **1. Cross over sign** - of anterior and posterior walls = acetabular retroversion
        - **2. Ischial spine Sign** - can see the ischial spine = Acetabular retroversion

    - 3. **Look for other deformities**
        - Coxa profunda/ Acetbular protrusio
        - Pistol Grip deformity - Cam lesion
        - Pincer lesions
- Special XR views for FAI?
    - **Dunn lateral view** - to measure Alpha angle
        - Hip flexed to 45 or 90 degrees with 20 ¬∞ abduction and neutral or slight IR.

- What are the XR measurements for CAM FAI?
    - Alpha angle (head neck center line \/ point where head loses sphericity) on Dunn Lateral (hip flexed to 45/ 90 with 20 deg abduction)
    - **More than 60 ¬∞** = abnormal

- What other imaging?
    - CT scan kiv 3D reconstruction to evaluate bony structure
    - MRI to evaluate articular cartilage, labral degeneration and tears/ cysts
- What is the management of FAI?
    - **Non op Mx = PT**

    - PAINLESS, **trendlenberg** gait, **Short Limb** gait (Vaulting or Tip toe)
    - Stiffness ROM, muscle wasting
    - Supine attitude of leg - may be ER
    - Shortening - Need to do LLD tests - Galeazzi, Bryant's
    - Thomas' test
- What other invx?
    - CT scan for bone stock
- What Classifx?
    - **Classfx** = Stulberg Classification
- **Mx = Non Op if minimal symptoms**
- **Mx = Op for YOUNG patient?**
    - Pelvic **osteotomy** to address hip instability from lateral hip subluxation = Bernese Periacetabular osteotomy
    - [Paeds Hip/ Pelvic Osteotomies](Paeds%20Hip%20Pelvic%20Osteotomies%204afb04e7dc824c149ce4d284b151a893.md)
    - proximal femur osteotomy to correct varus deformity
- **Mx = Op for OLD or SEVERE OA?**
    - This is a Complex primary hip
    - Pre op
        - Templating - assess LLD, expect to be shortened, so plan to lengthen slightly
        - Stand by senior surgeon
        - Plan for hybrid fixation - uncemented cup, cemented stem
    - Intraop -
        - Exposure - stand by extensile Trochanteric osteotomy
        - Dislocation - If previous op, expect contractures, distorted anatomy, neck cut first; Contracted - release glute max, psoas
        - Identify true acetabulum = TAL, placing acetabulum within the Lewinneck safe zones of inclination 40 +/-10 and anteversion 15 +/- 10
        - Standard cemented stem to adequate anteversion and depth
    - Post op
        - Standard hip precautions
