- What is bone?
    - Made up of matrix (90%) and cells (10%)
    - Matrix has inorganic (60%) and organic (40%)
- How can bone be divided? What are their properties?
    - Can be divided first into immature (aka woven) and mature (aka lamellae bone)
    - Mature bone - further divided into **Cortical** and **Cancellous** bone

- What is the characteristic of immature aka woven bone?
    - Isotropic, not organized. Collagen fibres are randomly arranged and have no lamellae
- What is the characteristic of mature bone?
    - Anisotropic
- ‼️ What is isotropy?
    - **Isotropic** = material behaves identically (uniform properties) irrespective of applied force e.g. most orthopaedic materials
    - **Anisotropy** = Behaviour is dependant on direction of the force (all living tissue e.g. BONE)
- Draw Cortical bone?
    - Draw **haversian systems** aka **Osteons** (circular tubes) with central haversian canals made of concentric lamella
    - Each Canal is surrounded by **5-7** concentric layers of bone matrix
    - In the rings there are **trapped osteocytes** which communicate via gap junctions called **canaliculi**
    - **Cement lines** separate osteons - these from areas of relative weakness along which cracks may propagate
    - Perpendicular **Volkmann canal** that carry blood vessels to and fro the haversian systems

- How about cancellous bone?
    - No haversian systems
    - Instead, a 3D lattice of interconnecting trabeculae, aligned along axes of mechanical stress
- Draw the stress strain curve for cortical vs cancellous bone?

- Tell me about Periosteum?
    - It is **outer fibrous** layer
    - **Inner cambria** layer - which is osteogenic and contains osteoblasts
- What are the Cells in bone?
    1. Oateoprogenitor cells - precursors to osteoblasts
    2. **Osteoblasts** - produce bone
        - 2. **osteocytes** - maintain bone
        - 5. Bone lining cells - **inactive osteoblasts**
    - 3. **Osteoclasts** - resorb bone
- Draw an osteoclast
    - Draw cell with **ruffled** border, tied down by **integrins** in a **howship lacunae.**
    - Cell has **multinucleus , mitochondria**
    - **3 things being released** - H+ by CAS (carbonic anhydrase systems), Acidic enzymes like Tartrate-resistant Acid phosphatase (TRAP), and Cathepsin K
    - Proteolytic **digestion** of **inorganic** components of bone
    - **Mitochondria** - to produce energy for ATP dependant proton pumps to pump H+ out

- Does osteoclast have PTH receptor?
    - No.
    - PTH works by attaching to osteoblasts which in turn produces RANKL that stimulates Ostoclasts activity
- What receptors does osteoclast have?
    - RANKL receptor
    - Calcitonin receptor - supresses osteoclast activity
    - OPG receptor - inhibits activity
- What is the usual blood supply to bone?
    - Usual blood supply is **CENTRIFUGAL** (F is DEFAULT) (in to out) [Venous blood flow is **CENTRIPETAL**]
    - **Nutrient artery** (high pressure) in cortex (inner 2/3)
    - **Periosteal** (from muscle attachment) (outer 1/3)
    - **Meta-epiphyseal systems** - from periarticular vasclar plexus
        
        ![Untitled](13%20Bone%20207e443441854368935e29d2ccc022ca/Untitled%204.png)
        
- What is the blood supply in other unique situations?
    - Immature bone ➔ **Centripetal** (out to in)
    - Children ➔ Due to thick and vascular periosteum ➔ **centripetal**
    - Fractured bone ➔ Centripetal
- ‼️What is the **bone remodelling cycle**?

    - **5 steps** that occur **simultaneously and asynchronously** at multiple different locations and is regulated by several signalling pathways such as
        - RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB)
        - Osteoprotegerin (OPG)
        - Hormones - PTH, vit D, thryroid hormones
    - **1. Activation** - Systemic hormones such as PTH in response to low calcium can initiate the process, or local initiation by osteocytes
    - **2. Resorption** - osteoclast activity
    - **3. Reversal** - reverses from resorption to bone formation - not well understood- 2 key events
        - **Osteoclasts secrete IL6 to stimulate osteoblast** activity
    - **4. Formation** - 2 parts
        - Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete type 1 collagen matrix
        - osteoblasts then regulate osteoid mineralization in the matrix
    - **5. Termination**
        - Once mineralization complete, osteoblasts undergo 3 fates
            - Apoptosis
            - Become bone lining cells
            - Entombed within bone matrix as osteocytes
- ‼️ ⚠️ Tell me about bone regulation?
    - Bone metabolism is regulated by hormones such as Vitamin D, PTH, Calcitonin and other thyroids such as Thyroxine
    - **Vitamin D:**  7-dehydrocholesterol ➔ (skin) Vitamin D3 (this is also consumed in diet) ➔ (liver) 25 hydroxy D3 [best to test in blood] ➔ (kidney) 1,25 Hydroxy D3 ➔ increased Calcium absorption from GIT
        
        ![Untitled](13%20Bone%20207e443441854368935e29d2ccc022ca/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - **PTH** is from **Chief cells**, produced when Ca is low ➔ Produces 3 effects
        - Kidney - increase activation of Vit D
        - Kidney - increase reabsorption of Ca, decreased reabsorption of phosphate
        - Osteoclasts - increase activity (does this by activating osteoblasts which then secrete RANKL that binds to osteoclasts)
    - **Calcitonin** is from **Parafollicular C cells**, produced when Ca is high, inhibits the activity of osteoclasts
- ‼️ What are the bone remodelling theories?
    - **Wolff's** Law
        - Bone remodels in response to mechanical stress
        - So when there is compression of the bone, it is electronegative by the piezoeletric remodelling ➔ more osteoblasts ➔ more bone.
    - **Piezoelectric** remodelling (for cortical bone) ➔ explain's wolff's law
        - **Compression** side is **electronegative** and **stimulates** osteoblast formation
        - Tension side is electropositive and stimulates osteoclasts
    - **Hueter-Volkmann Principle (**for physis)
        - Compressive forces inhibit growth
- ‼️  What is in bone matrix?
    - Consists of organic and inorganic matrix
    - **Inorganic** - Primarily **calcium hydroxyapatite** [compressive strength] - Ca10 (PO4)6 (OH)2
    - **Organic** - type 1 collagen (90%) [tensile strength], proteoglycans [compression strength]
- What is the function of bone?
    - Reservoir of calcium
    - Hematopoeitic Marrow
    - Mechanical Role - protection, attachment, structure
- Which cell lineage are osteoblasts and osteoclasts from?
    - Osteoblasts are from **mesenchymal** progenitors.
    - Osteoclasts are from **hematopoietic** progenitors

- What are the 2 cytokines that interact with osteoclasts?
    - RANKL
    - Osteoprotegerin also binds to RANKL-L, **inhibiting** osteoclast activiation
        - Denosumab mimics function of osteoprotegerin and inhibits osteoclast activity!
