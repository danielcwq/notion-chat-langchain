### Scapula

- What classification of scapular fractures?
    - Ideberg Classification - based on involvement of glenoid as well as extension to medial scapula
    - Type 1 = anterior(a) or Posterior (b) glenoid rim
    - Type 2 = inferior glenoid rim
    - Type 3 = Superior glenoid rim extending to base of coracoid
    - Type 4 – horizontal # through neck to medial scapula
    - Type 5 – horizontal # + partial articular glenoid #
- Management of scapula fractures?
    - Non operative management is main stay
    - Zlowodzki JOT 2006 systematic review.
    - 99% of isolated body # treated non op; 86% acceptable results
- ‼️ ⚠️ Indications for scapular fixation?

    - Glenopolar Angle **< 22 degree** (i.e. inferior angulation)
        - Angle between line connecting cranial and caudal point of glenoid and line connecting most cranial of glenoid with most caudal point of scapular body
            
            ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%201.png)
            
    - Medialization **(Lateral Border Offset) LFO > 25mm**
    - **Angulation** > 45 degrees (AP angulation ➔ may impinge on ribs)
    - Floating Shoulder
    - Glenoid involvement and displacement
- What is the approach to scapula?
    
    
    ### **Posterior Judet Approach**
    
    - InterN plane – Infraspinatous (SS nerve) and Teres minor (axillary)
    - D (2) – SS nerve in suprascapular notch, axillary nerve and posterior circumflex artery in quadrangular space
    - P – lateral
    - I – along scapular spine and curved inferior medially
    - D – expose and sharp dissect **deltoid** off scapular spine ➔ Identify ISP (superior) and TM (inferior) ➔ retract TM inferiorly together with the quadrangular and triangular space away ➔ joint capsule

### Floating Shoulder

- What is the Superior Shoulder Suspensory Complex (SSSC)?
    - Bone and soft tissue structure **4+2**
        
        ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Made up of 4 bony prominences - coracoid, acromion, clavicle, glenoid
    - 2 ligaments - Coracoclavicular ligaments, acromioclavicular ligaments
- What is floating shoulder?
    - The floating shoulder is defined as ipsilateral fractures of the **midshaft of the clavicle** and the **neck of the glenoid.** As described by Ganz and Noesberger in 1975
    - [https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/full/10.1302/0301-620X.88B11.17997](https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/full/10.1302/0301-620X.88B11.17997)
- What is the management of floating shoulder?
    - **Controversial** - systematic review by **Dombrosky et al. in JSES 2020** found that op vs non op when appropriately individualized to patient had satisfactory outcomes.
        - Injuries with significant displacement of scapular neck may benefit from surgery. (GPA)
    - **Controversial** – Morey et al. (NUH Paper) – systematic review no difference in
        - non op
        - vs fix clavicle only
        - vs fix clavicle and scapular neck.
    - **Outcomes correlate with restoration of GPA**

### Coracoid Fracture

- Classification of coracoid fracture?
    - Ogawa Classification
        
        ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - 1 = behind CC ligament (base) [94% associated with Floating Shoulder]
    - 2 = Anterior to CC ligament

### ACROMION FRACTURE

- What is the classification of acromion fracture?
    - Classifx = Khun’s
    - 1a = avulsion
    - 1b = undisplaced true fracture
    - 2 = Displaced without reduction of subacromial space
    - 3 = Displaced with reduction of subacromial space
    - Reduced space can be due to Superior displacement of glenoid fracture or inferior displacement of acromion fracture
- Indications for surgery of acromion fracture?
    - Khun’s type 3 (reduced subacromial space)
    - Displacement > 1cm
- Options for acromion fracture?
    - Reversed distal clavicle plate

### Clavicle Fractures

- Which type of clavicle fractures most common?
    - Midshaft 80%!
- What are the deforming forces in clavicle fractures?
    - Weight of arm ➔ pulling distal fragment distally
    - SCM and trapezius ➔ pulling proximal fragment proximally
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the anatomy of CC ligaments? What direction of stability do they confer
    - C is more central; Trapezoid is 3cm from ACJ, Conoid is 4.5cm from ACJ
        - [CV] **Conoid** - stabilizer against **vertical**
        - **Trapezoid** - stabilizer against **horizontal**
    
    ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%204.png)
    
- What are the absolute indications for surgery?
    - Open, neurovascular, tenting with skin at risk

### SCENARIO: Midshaft Clavicle Fracture

- What are the risk factors of MIDSHAFT clavicle non union [Relative indications for op]?
    - “Traditionally, based on the 2007 COTS RCT, higher risk of nonunion (1.6% vs 14.3%) if displaced and shortened. Also seen in McKee 2012 meta-analysis. However, more recent studies like Robinson 2013 RCT found nonunion rates indeed higher 16 vs 1% with functional scores consistently better with ORIF. However, when nonunion are excluded from analysis, no difference in DASH or constant scores. NNT to prevent one non union is 6. Thus reasonable to offer non op with possibly secondary fixation and bone grafting”
    - COTS 2007 JBJS paper, RCT of 132 displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. Fixation significantly improved functional outcome with **faster rate of union**. Lower non union (1.6% vs **14.3%**)
    - **Mckee 2012 Meta-ananlysis.** Found non union and symptomatic malunion rates higher in non operative (**23%** vs 1%)
    - James Hill 1997 landmark paper found that if initial shortening of fracture > 2cm, higher risk of non union
    - However, recent study by J**BJS 2013 Robinson et al. Multicenter RCT of 200 displaced clavicle fractures.** Rate of nonunion is higher with non op (**16%** vs 1%). NNT is 6 to prevent one non union.
        - DASH and constant scores better with ORIF
        - However, when non union excluded from analysis, no significant difference in DASH or Constant scores.
        - Study does not support routine primary open reduction and plate fixation
    - It is thus reasonable to do non operative management, followed by the possibility of secondary fixation or bone grafting if develop symptomatic non union

- ‼️ **How will you manage this midshaft clavicle fracture? [revised]**
    - No consensus on the optimal treatment for a displaced midshaft clavicle fracture
    - Multiple randomized controlled trials such as COTS in 2007, The Clavicle Trial in 2017 and recent trial in JBJS ilija Ban found consistent non union rates of 1% vs 10-15%
    - However, it is not conclusive if surgical fixation improves long term outcomes of the shoulder.
        - The Clavicle Trial which is a multi RCT did not find any difference in DASH score at 9 months.
        - Ilija Ban RCT also did not find any difference in DASH scores at 1 year
    - As such, I will counsel my patient on the risks and benefits regarding GA and specific risks as well as the exchanging of a deformity for a scar and allow him to make an informed decision.

- What is your approach to the clavicle?
    - Clavicle Anterior Approach
        - P - supine, sand bag between medial border of scapula and spine
        - I - Along the subcutaneous clavicle
        - D - Skin, fascia, platysma muscle, try to presever supraclavicluar nerves
- Anterior vs Superior plating?
    - No consensus on biomechanics superiority of one over another
    - Uzer JSES 2017 biomechanical study - Anterior plate had greatest bending stiffness while Torsional failure load highest in superior and SAC.
    - **Superior** – on tension side, but higher risk of NV injury
    - **Anterior** – plate less prominent, longer AP screws for better pull out strength
    - In my practice, I frequently use SAC plate with the reasoning of less NV risk and longer screws for purchase with less prominence.
- How will you manage non union?
    - Rule out infection triple assessment
    - Hypertrophic vs atrophic
    - Re fix with bone grafting

### SCENARIO: Distal Clavicle Fracture

- What classification for Distal Clavicle Fracture?
    - Classifx = Neer’s
    
    ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - 1 = lateral to CC stable,
    - 2 = medial to CC unstable,
    - 3 = Intra-articular
    - 4 = physis,
    - 5 = comminuted
- Why are Neer 2 and 5 unstable?
    - When fracture is medial to the CC, then there is unopposed downward force the weight of the arm resulting in instability and greater displacement

- What are the risk factors of DISTAL clavicle nonunion?
    - Robinson 2004 JBJS - Cohort study of 868 pateints. Higher risk of nonunion for advancing age and displacement of fracture
    - They did note that many patients with nonunions are relatively asymptomatic and did not need subsequent intervention.
- What are the options for distal clavicle fracture?
    - Distal clavicle plates
    - Hook plate
    - Suspensory device

- **‼️ How will you treat this distal clavicle fracture?**
    - No consensus in literature
    - Robinson in 2004, found that displacement and advancing age are risks of non union
    - In recent RCT by COTS Jeremy Hall 2021, non union rates were **5% vs 36%** with **no difference in functional outcomes at 1 year.**
        - However, 20% of patients treated non operatively had delayed surgery to correct deformity
        - While 44% of patients treated surgically had to undergo second surgery for implant removal
    - Hence, I will discuss with the patient and allow informed consent.
    - options include suspensory device vs hooked plate
- #📜 How will you manage this displaced lateral clavicle fracture?
    - Acute - ATLS, Sling, analgesia
    - Depend on pateint and injury factors
    - Pateint - age, dominance
    - Injury - risk of nonunion in displaced fractures. Unstable in view of this being a Neer2/ Neer 5
    - Inclined towards surgery
    - Goals/ Approach/ Surgery
    - Aware of options of hook plate vs distal clavicle plate depending on bone stock availability

### ACJ Dislocation

- ⚠️ How will you classify ACJ Dislocation? What structures are damaged at each stage?
    - Rockwood
    - 1 = 0. [ACJ sprain]
    - 2 = < 25% [**ACJ** torn and CC strain]
    - 3 = 25-100% [**AC** and CC torn]
    - 4 = Posterior
    - 5 = > 100% displacement [Deltotrapezial fascia torn]
    - 6 = inferior [sex below]
    
    ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%206.png)
    
- How to differentiate type 4 and the rest?
    - You need an **axillary view** - to see posterior translation
- What special XR?
    - Zanca view = 10 ° below horizontal in the plane of the clavicles
    - Bilateral clavicles on same film to allow comparison of CC distance
        
        ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%207.png)
        
- What are the absolute indications for surgery?
    - Type 4 and 6
    - Open fracture, Neurovascular deficit

- What is the controversy in ACJ dislocation?
    - There is **no consensus in the optimal treatment for high grade ACJ dislocation**
    - Nicholas Chang et al. Meta-analysis in JOT 2018 found no clinical difference between op and non op for grades 3-5. Non op had more rapid RTW but poorer cosmetic outcome
        
        [ACJ MA.pdf](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/ACJ_MA.pdf)
        
    - Joukainen et al. in OJSM published a 20 year follow up of high grade ACJ in 25 patients. RCT op vs non op. Equally good clinical results but radiographically wider ACJ
        
        [Joukainen .pdf](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Joukainen_.pdf)
        
    - In essence, it is replacing a bump for scar. I will discuss with the patient the pros and cons for the surgery and allow him to make an informed consent
- Should the patient agree for surgery, what options in ACUTE dislocation < 6wk?
    - Principle is to reduce joint, to allow scaring and healing of the soft tissues
    - Myriad of fixation techniques
    - Hook plate
        - Pros: biomechanically stonger contruct
        - Cons: Acromiolysis, acromion fracture
    - Suspensory
        - pros – obviate need for removal, can be done arthroscopically
        - Cons – risk of coracoid fracture
    - Outcomes - meta-analysis no difference in outcomes or complication rates but different types of complications.

- What about chronic management?
    - Principle is that, there is no more ability for scarring and healing and thus need to reconstruct the ligament
    - **Non anatomic** = **Modified Weaver Dunn** = Coracoacromial ligament transfer to distal end of clavicle
        
        ![Untitled](Shoulder%20Injuries%20-%20Scapula%20Floating%20Coracoid%20Acro%20cf031ca1f21448019b0893b53a7fad37/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - **Anatomic recon** = reconstruction of both AC and CC ligaments with ligament allografts
