- ‼️ ⚠️ What is DNA made of?
    - DNA is DeoxyriboNucleic Acid.
    - There are 23 pairs of chromosomes, including 2 sex chromosomes

    - Consists of 2 sugar phosphate backbone connected via 4 types of **nitrogenous** bases

- What can the body do with DNA?
    - Replication into another DNA, Transcription into mRNA (which is then translated into protein)

- Difference between DNA and mRNA?
    - Uracil instead of thymine

- What defects can genes undergo?
    - 5 - deletion, duplication, inversion, substitution, translocation

- What is an autosome?
    - A non sex linked chromosome

## INHERITANCE

- What are the types of inheritance?
    - Mendelian - AR and AD
    - Non-Mendelian - XLR, XLD, Incomplete dominance, co- dominance, mulitple alleles (e.g. blood types), imprinting, mosaicism
- How can inheritance be described and visualized?
    - Punnett Squares
    - Pedigree Charts

- If i tell you this is Autosomal dominant, why in row 2 it skips one generation?
    - **Variable penetrance**
- Draw the Punnett Square for XLR conditions (DMD)?

    - Mother is a carrier, Father is normal [Males with Duchennes die at 20, so they do not reproduce]
    - Females will hardly ever get Duchenne as it requires a carrier to breed with a DMD male
    - If son, then 50% chance has Duchennes
    - If female 50% chance is a carrier

### STEM CELLS

- What are stem cells?
    - Unspecialized cells with the ability to differentiate into specialized cell types and they demonstrate 2 defining features
        - **1. Self renewal** - ability to go through numerous cycles of cell division while remaining undifferentiate
        - **2. Potency** - capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types.
- ⚠️ What types of potency are there?
    - **Totipotent** - capacity to form an **ENTIRE** organism
    - **Pluripotent** - can differentiate into **ANY** cell type
    - **Multipotent** - can differentiate into **more than one cell type** but more limited than pluripotent cells
- What types of stem cells are there?
    - Mainly 2 kinds
        - 1. **Embryonic** Stem cells
        - 2. **Adult Stem** cells
- What are the uses of stem cells in Orthopaedics?
    - Mainly in regenerative medicine with Adult stem cells harvest directly from bone marrow
    - Goal is to replace or replenish diseased tissues
        - Articular cartilage damage/ degeneration - use of stem cells hope to create growth of primary hyaline cartilage
        - Ligaments and tendon injury e.g. rotator cuff tear, achilles tendon injuries.
        - Meniscus injury
- Any concerns of stem cells?
    - In view of self renewal and high proliferation rate ➔ Risk of **tumor** growth and promoting metastases
    - **Ethical** issues if using embryonic stem cells
    - **Donor site morbidity** from stem cell harvesting
    - **Costs**
    - **Biological** - hard to control stem cell differentiation into desired cell lineage
