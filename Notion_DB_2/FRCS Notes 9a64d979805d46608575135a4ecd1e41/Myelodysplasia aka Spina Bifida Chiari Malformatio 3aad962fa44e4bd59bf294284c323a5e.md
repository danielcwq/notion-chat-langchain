- What is Myelodysplasia?
    - **Failure of closure** of fetal spinal cord, presenting with anatomic and neurologic impairments
- ‼️ What are the risk factors for myelodysplasia?
    - **Folate** deficiency - supplementation decreases risk by 70%
    - **Valproic** acid
    - Maternal **diabetes**
    - Maternal hyperthermia
- ‼️ What are the 4 types of spina bifida?

    - Spina Bifida Occulta
        - Can present with hemangioma, portwine stain, pseudotail with lipomna, hypertrichosis

    - Meningocele = protruding sac without spinal elements
    - Myelomeningocele = protruding sac with spinal elements
    - **Rachishsis** = cleft throughout the spine
- What is are the various functioning levels?
    - Can be confusing! if Lesion at L3, then L2 and above is still functioning.
    
    L2 - non ambulator
    L3 - marginal home ambulation. Hip dislocation ++. Equinovarus foot.
    L4 - Household ambulation. Equinovarus foot.
    L5 - Community. Calcaneovalgus foot.
    S - Community. Pes Cavus Foot

- Which level highest risk of **hip dislocation**?
    - Occurs when knee is flexed (looses extension at L3) and Hips are flexed (L2 maintained)
    - Highest risk is thus defect at L3.
- What interesting allergy do patients with myeodysplasia have?
    - Latex allergy (reported 20-70%)
    - Cause is unknown, may be due to early, constant exposure to rubber products among thse children

### Foot in MYELODYSPLASIA

    - Sacral myelodysplasia means L5 and above intact
    - Elevated longitudinal arch aka cavus is the primary deformity
    - Varus then results from **muscle imbalance** between posterior tibialis  and peroneal muscles
- What Foot deformities do we expect in **Low Lumbar Myeodysplasia**? (L5)

    - L5 lesion means L4 and above intact and dorsiflexion is intact
    - It is most common in patients with L4 or L5 level of involvement, “**due to the strength or spasticity of the ankle dorsiflexors combined with weak or absent plantar flexors**”
    - Calcaneus or Calcaneovalgus.

    Right CCV in adult
    
    - Most common in patients with L5 and L4 levels of involvement due to strength or spasticity of ankle dorsiflexors combined with weak or absent plantar flexors
- Management of calcaneovalgus due to Myelodysplasia?
    - Anterior tibialis tendon transfer to calcaneus with anterolateral ankle release

- What Foot deformity do we expect in **High Lumbar myelodysplasia (L4 and above)**?
    - If lesion is at L4, means L3 and above intact. Means dorsiflexion is also affected.
    - **Equinovarus** foot aka Club foot
    - Occurs in 90% of patients with thoracic or lumbar levels
    - Develop due to **“retained activity of tibialis muscles” in combination with the “functional absence of peroneal muscles”**
- What other proximal muscle weaknesses do we expect for higher lumbar levels?
    - L3 = L4 and below weak = equinovarus foot + foot drop
    - L2 = L3 and below weak = + Knee extensors weak
    - L1 = L2 and below weak = + Hip flexors weak
- Management of non idiopathic club foot associated with spina bifida?
    - Ponseti method - can be successful in most cases.
    - +/- soft tissue release later

### Chiari Malformations

- What is Chiari Malformations?
    - Deformities of the posterior fossa and hind brain resulting in herniation of the hind brain through the foramen magnum

- What are the types of chiari malformations?
    - There are 2 main types
    - **Type 1** = Least severe, **cerebellar tonsils only** herniate > 5mm below the McRae Line
    - **Type 2** = Cerebellar **+ brain stem** herniation
        - More severe; ALWAYS has a myelomeningocele
- What is the association of syrinx and scoliosis with CM type 1?
    - Syrinx and Scoliosis present in 10-20% of patients with CM 1
    - However, there are patients with CM1 without syrinx but with scoliosis
    - Syrinx due to CM1 is a non communicating syrinx
- What is the mechanism of syrinx causing scoliosis?
    - Cause is not determined
    - Some believe syrinx injures lower motor neurons, causing imbalance of trunk musculature an predispose to scoliosis
- Clinical presentation of CM type 1?
    - Most common presenting symptom is headache, with or without posterior cervical pain which occurs in 28-63% of patients.
    - pain is severe and paroxysmal, related to valsalva maneuver
- Management of CM type 1 [more common for spine]?
    - **Posterior fossa decompression** to restore normal physiologic CSF flow at craniocervical junction with C1 laminectomy
- Management of CM type 2?
    - All require myelomeningocele closure within 72 hours of birth
    - Most will require CSF diversion for hydrocephalus

### Syringomyelia

- What is syringomyelia?
    - It is a central cavitation of the spinal cord
- Causes of syringomyelia?
    - **Communicating** Syrinx (with 4th ventricle)
        - Complex CM2
        - Communicating hydrocephalus
    - **Non-communicating** syrinx
        - CM 1
        - Basilar invagination
        - Spinal cord trauma/ ischemia
        - Post TB
    - **Atrophic** Cavitations (due to spinal atrophy)
    - **Neoplastic** cavitations - astro
- Clinical presentation of syringomyelia?
    - **Cape-like loss** of sensation  ➔ Charcot shoulder
    - Lower extremities may have increased reflexes and spasticity
- What is the management of a syrinx?
    - Direct management - placing a shunt
        - Syringosubarachnoid shunt
        - Syringopleural shunt
    - Indirect - by decompressing posterior fossa
- What is syringomyelia associated with?
    - Scoliosis
    - Charcot shoulder
- Can treatment of syrinx halt or reverse progression of scoliosis?
    - Yes
    - Also, after decompression of the syrinx, surgical correction of scoliosis can be performed with less neurologic risk
