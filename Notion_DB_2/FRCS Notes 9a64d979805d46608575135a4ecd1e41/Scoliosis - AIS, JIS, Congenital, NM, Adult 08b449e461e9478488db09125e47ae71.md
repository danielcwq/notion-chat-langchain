Dystrophic NF curve

### Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis

- What is scoliosis?
    - It is a 3D deformity of the spine in coronal, sagital and rotational planes. It is however defined as lateral curvature of spine of > 10 ° Cobb angle
- What are the age groups for Idiopathic Scoliosis?
    - Infantile < 3 year old
    - Juvenile 4-10 years old
    - Adolescent > 10 yo
- What is the most common curve direction?
    - Right thoracic curve
- What is the definition of thoracic/ Thoracolumbar/ Lumbar curves?
    - Based on the SRS criteria, depend on where Apex is
    - T = T2-T11/12 disc
    - TL = T12-L1
    - L = L1/2 Disc to L4
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%202.png)
        
- How do you check abdominal reflexes?
    - Patient supine and relaxed
    - Use an orange stick to stroke briskly but lightly in a medial direction acorss upper and lower quadrant of the abdomen
    - Normal = contraction of underlying muscles with umbilicus moving laterally and up and down depending on the quadrant tested
    - Looking for asymmetry
- ‼️ What is the Singapore screening program for scoliosis?
    - Girls - check at 11 yo primary 5 and secondary 2
    - Boys - check only at secondary 2
    - Consists of Adam's forward bending test with Scoliometer.
    - **> 5 °** ➔ do XR, Cobb > 10 ➔ refer specialist

- ‼️ What makes a successful screening test? - (DDH, Scoliosis)
    - There are **three groups of criteria**
    - **Disease** Criteria (4)
        - Disease must have significant **impact**
        - Natural **history** of disease is known
        - Detection can occur before a **critical point** before being too late
        - There must be accepted and **effective treatment** available
    - **Screening** test features (3)
        - Accepted and tolerated
        - **High sensitivity** - Low false negatives (can catch more - if there are low false negatives, then there has to be false positives)
        - **High specificity** reduces false positive
    - **Population** features
        - Disease must have high enough prevalance [**Scoliosis 3%,** DDH 1:1000]
        - Patients willing to undergo treatment
- What is the Adam's forward bending test? and the concurrent Scoliometer?
    - Stand with feet and knees together
    - Bend down and watch for rub hump
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Looking for asymmetry and rib hump
    - Scoliometer - 5-7 ° equivalent to 15-20 ° cobb angle
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%204.png)
        
- ‼️⚠️  What do you report on the Scoliosis XR?
    - **On the curve** - Side of curve, offer to measure cobb angle at the end vertebrae (which are..), apex
    - **Red flag features** - missing pedicles, widened pedicles (tumors), short sharp curves, pencilling bars and fused vertebrae
    - **Maturity** - Look at iliac crest for Risser’s score (0-5)
    - **Ask** to look for bending films (to assess structural) and sagittal films (to assess kyphotic component)
- What are features of non-idiopathic curve? And thus want to do an **MRI** scan?
    - **History** – symptoms of a generalized syndrome or disorder (e.g. muscular dystrophy of neurofibromatosis), back pain, neurology such as weakness in any limbs, bowel or bladder symptoms. Juvenile < 10 years old
    - **Examination** – asymmetrical reflexes, neurology, foot abnormalities, no rotational rib hump, atypical kyphosis
    - **Investigations** – X-ray findings of atypical left-sided curve, acute angular curve, scalloping of vertebrae or pencilling of ribs.
    - **MRI features** such as bone and spinal cord anomalies, syrinx, tumour or infection.
- What are the **definitions of the vertebrae** and their purpose?
    - **End** vertebrae = **most tilted** from horizontal [used in measuring Cobb's angle]
    - **Stable** vertebrae = **most proximal vertebrae body that is bisected by Central Sacral Vertical Line** [usually the most distal fixation]
    - **Neutral** vertebrae = No rotation
    - **Apical Vertebrae =** most deviated
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%205.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%206.png)
        
- What are predictors for curve progression?
    - Progression depends on remaining growth
    - We can assess remaining growth clinically, radiologically
- How do you assess **remaining growth**?
    - **"Clinically and Radiologically"**
    - Purpose is to determine where the child is in relation to peak height velocity as a guide to know when the child can undergo bracing
    - Puberty begins at a bone age of 11 in girls, and 13 in boys. Characterized by a rapid growth phase known as "peak height velocity"
    - PHV reached in 2 years, Usually reaches skeletal maturity 2 years after menarche or Riser 1 (This would be the **time to stop bracing**)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - **Clinical**
        - Menarche, Voice break (equivalent to menarche)
            - Menarche often occur at 13.5 years of bone age, usually when Risser 1, signals the beginning of the deceleration phaze
            - PHV precendes menarche by a year
        - Taner's staging - Stage 2 signals beginning of puberty
    - **Radiological**
        - Risser Classification - **“extent of iliac crest ossification of apophysis”**
            
            ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%208.png)
            
        - Left hand XR -
            - Compare to Greulich -Pule atlas
            - **Sanders** classification
                - Stage 1 = all digital epiphysis not covered
                - Sanders 3 = fusion of Middle phalanges = Risser 1
                
                ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%209.png)
                
- How is Cobb's angle measured?
    - 1. Identify end vertebrae which is the level with greatest tilt from horizontal
    - 2. Draw line from upper border and lower border respectively
- How to differentiate flexible and structural curve?
    - **Clinically** - flexible curves normalizes when sitting down and pelvic leveled (due to pelvic oblquity), also normalizes on forward bend test
    - **On XR** - Flexible curve normalizes with lateral bending
    - Based on the Lenke classification, **it is structural if it does not correct to less than 25° for coronal angles and 20 ° for kyphotic angles**
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- ‼️ How do you classify the AIS curve?
    - Lenke Classification - based on 3 components
        - **Location** of structural curve with 2 modifiers -
            - presence of **thoracic kyphosis** (T5-T12) and
            - Coronal alignment by the **CSVL to lumbar apex**
        - In other words, 3 parts to the classificaiton - the number, the letter and the sagittal
            - Number 1-6 = different configuration of structural vs non structural
            - Letter A/B/C = Lumbar modifier
            - Sagittal profile of **T5-T12**
                - <10 (-hypo)
                - 10-40 (normal)
                - 40 (+ hyper)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2011.png)
        
    - Nash Moe Classification for rotation
        - Grade: neutral
        - 1 - pedicle diseappearing
        - 2 - no more pedicle
        - 3 - Migrate **to middle** segment
        - 4 = migrates **past midlne**
            
            ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2012.png)
            
- What is the treatment protocol?
    - <25 = observe
    - 25-40 = bracing based on SRS criteria
    - > 40 = Surgery
    
    ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2013.png)
    
- ‼️ Do we need routine Pre Op MRI?
    - This is a consideration for some surgeons
    - Kevin Lim KKH - does routine MRI for all pre op even for AIS
    - **Ozturk et al.** - 249 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Routine MRI- **8%** (20) has neural axis abnormalities - e.g. arnold chiari malformations, epidural lipoma
        - **3 of them required surgical intervention** for syringomyelia
    - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903144/#:~:text=In conclusion%2C magnetic resonance imaging,treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903144/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging,treatment%20of%20adolescent%20idiopathic%20scoliosis).

### BRACING

- ‼️ What is the SRS (scoliosis research society) Criteria for bracing?
    - 5 criteria
        - 1. Magnitude - 25 - 40 °
        - 2. > 10 year old
        - 3. Risser 0-2 [Risser 1 coincides with menarche]
        - 4. Pre-menarche or **< 1 year postmenarchal**. [Risser 1 coincides with menarche. So if we want Risser 0-2, then we can accomodate for Pre-menarche or < 1 year post menarchial]
        - 5. No Prior treatment
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2014.png)
        
- What is the recommended time in brace?
    - Success of brace is **time dependant**
    - Weinstein et al. NEJM 2013 – **12.9 hours a day a/w 90-93% success**
    - Multi-center study of 242 patients randomized into bracing or observation. Bracing group **advised to wear 18 hours a day**. Trial was stopped early due to the efficacy of bracing!
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2015.png)
        
    
    [weinstein-effects-of-bracing.pdf](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/weinstein-effects-of-bracing.pdf)
    
- What must you communicate to the parents?
    - 1. Success of brace is time dependant
    - 2. Does NOT reverse but only halt progression!
    - Can give a car analogy. Car is moving very fast and we are trying to put on the brakes. But even if we do that, there is a chance that it still can worsen
- How do you assess the patient post bracing?
    - Check pressure points arm pits, sitting, standing
- How do you assess the post bracing XR?
    - Lengthening must be achieved - level shoulders
    - Cobb angle target - aiming for **50%** correction of cobb angle
    - 3 points fixation
    - Rotational correction (Nashmoe classification)
- When do you stop bracing?
    - Growth completed as seen from - **Risser 4/ 5, 2 years post menarche**
    - OR when curve reach surgical magnitude of 40 degrees

### SURGERY for AIS

- What is the goal of surgery?
    - Aims to prevent progression
    - Correction is only partial nor full correction.
- When do you need surgery?
    - When curve > 45 degrees before skeletal maturity ➔ likely will progress
    - When curve > 50 degrees at skeletal maturity ➔ will continue to progress
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- What levels do you fuse until?
    
    ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2017.png)
    
    - Proximally - difficult to determine. Some surgeons fuse to T2 if one shoulder is elevated
    - Distally - fuse to **stable** vertebrae
        - In adult scoliosis, fusion to sacrum improves correction and maintenance of saggital balance but increases risk
    - Major curve must be addressed. By definition it is structural
- What options of surgery/ approaches?
    - Posterior instrumentation and fusion
    - +/- Anterior instrumentation and fusion
        - Indications - Large stiff curves > 75 deg, For very young patients to prevent crank shaft
    - Transthoracic thoracoscopic assisted surgery (NUH) for single curves
- What do you know about **Growth modulation?**
    - **Anterior** - Vertebral body tethering (works by heuter volkman principle)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2018.png)
        
    - **Posterior** - non fusion for AIS with **ApiFix**

- What complications from scoliosis surgery?
    - **Early** complications
        - Neurologic - paraplegia 1:1000
        - Dural injury
        - infection - **Proprionibacterium acnes** most common organism for delayed infection
        - SMA syndrome [AKA Cast syndrome] - compression of 3rd part of duodenum due to compression between SMA and Aorta when spine is straightened ➔ **intenstinal obstruction**
            
            ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2019.png)
            
        - DVT, PE
    - **Late** complications
        - **Flat back syndrome** - failure to restore lordosis or kyphosis leading to early fatigability and back pain
        - Pseudoarthrosis/ non union
        - Hardware failure
        - Junctional failure
        - Adjacent segment disease
        - [Young] Crankshaft phenomenon - rare now due to pedicle screws ability to catch anterior vertebral body
            
            ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2020.png)
            
            - Rotational deformity of spine created by continued Anterior spinal growth in setting of posterior spinal fusion
            - Can occur in your patients when PSF is performed alone and anterior column is allowed continued growth
            - Avoid by fusing anterior also
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2021.png)
        
- What Pre op preparation?
    - Instruments and implants
    - Neuromonitoring
    - Imagine intensifiers

### Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis

- Do all need MRI scan?
    - Yes
- What is Thoracic insufficiency syndrome?
    - Inability of thoracic to support normal respiration or lung growth
- How can you break down age group further?
    - Early onset vs late onset
    - < 5 year old - poorer prognosis due to Thoracic Insufficiency syndrome -
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2022.png)
        
    - > 6 year old better prognosis
- What is the management of Juvenile Scoliosis?
    - Similar to AIS
    - < 20 ° observation
    - Cobb 20-50 = Brace
    - Cobb > 50 = growth modulation = growing rods or tether if still growth potential
    - If surgery and fusion may need to consider to add anterior instrumentation

### Neuromuscular Scoliosis

![Screenshot 2022-07-01 at 8.22.18 AM.png](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Screenshot_2022-07-01_at_8.22.18_AM.png)

Clues that this is NM scoliosis - supine film, look at hips as well (pelvic obliquity and dysplasia), many **tubes** - note the anteversion here

- What is the difference between NM scoliosis and Idiopathic scoliosis?
    - Rapidly progressive
    - a/w pelvic Obliquity
    - Progresses after maturity
    - More severe – longer
    - Higher rate of pulmonary complications with surgery
- What are the complications of neuromuscular scoliosis?
    - Affects sitting balance, may need hands - "hand dependant seater"
    - **Rib impingement** into ilium - pain, difficult hygeine
    - Swallowing difficulties
    - Respiratory complications
    - Pressure sores
- What are the 2 types of Neuromuscular curves?
    - **Type 1** = **Double** curves with minimal pelvic obliquity
    - **Type 2** = **Single** curves but greater magnitude a/w pelvic obliquity
- ‼️ How can you **classify** Neuromuscular curves?
    - UMN - CP
    - LMN - SMA
    - Myopathic - DMD
    - Syndromic - Neurofibromatosis
- Preoperative considerations for Neuromuscular scoliosis?
    - **Multidisciplinary**
    - **Neurology** – seizure control
    - **Respiratory** – Assess Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), may need post op NIV
    - **GIT -** GERD present in up to 70% leading to aspiration (consider fundoplication)
    - **Osteoporosis** - Vit D supplementation
    - **Nutrition** – assess albumin levels KIV NGT for nutrition [Low serum albumin a/w increased rates of post op complications]
- Complications of NM scoliosis correction?
    - **General** – Pulmonary, infection, bleeding, scars, spinal cord injuries, Blindness (long position), IO from mesenteric syndrome
    - **Surgery** – **mesenteric infarct** from curve correction, pelvic fixation (bowel and bladder), Pseudarthrosis
- General Goals of Fusion surgery in NM Scoliosis?
    - **Goals - 2**
        - 1. Obtain **painless solid fusion (**Typically from T2 to Pelvis to overcome muscular deforming forces)
        - 2. **Correction of Pelvic obliquity** to achieve a level pelvis
    - Indications: Curves 50 – 90 degrees
- What are the surgical options?
    - Posterior Spinal Fusion with extension to pelvis [T2 to pelvis]
    - +/- Anterior procedure if large curve > 60-80 degrees of immature patients at risk of crankshaft growth

## CP Scoliosis

![Screenshot 2022-07-01 at 8.22.18 AM.png](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Screenshot_2022-07-01_at_8.22.18_AM.png)

- What are the risk factors for CP scoliosis?
    - Linked to global disability. Assessed based on
        - GMFCS (Gross Motor Function Classification System) - the higher the scoring, the higher the incidence
        - Walking ability
    - Height and weight not risk factors
    - Progression is variable, 3-4 deg/year
- Mx of CP scoliosis
    - Bracing is poorly tolerated, ineffective
    - Optimize seating position with 3 point system of lateral support pads and “tilt in space” chairs
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%201.png)
        
- Surgical management of CP Scoliosis?
    - Indications - Curves 50-90deg
    - **Ponte** osteotomies to correct kyphotic deformity
    - KIV anterior procedure – if rigid kyphosis
- Outcomes of surgery?
    - Prospective studies whilst parents are satisfied, surgery provided no improvement in function, school attendance or co-morbidities
    - Some systematic review suggest improvement in QOL
- Will you correct the scoliosis first or fix the hip first?
    - Principle if correct proximal first
    - Hip dislocation is contributed by pelvic obliquity leading to uncoverage
    - Correcting the pelvic obliquity will confer coverage, may not need further hip procedures

### DMD Scoliosis/ SMA Scoliosis

- What are the other features of DMD?
    - Progressive weakness of proximal muscles
    - Gait abnormalities; delayed walking
    - Calf pseudohypertrophy
    - Gower’s sign (glutes and quads weakness) - patient requires to turn prone, and push himself up to stand

    - Lumbar lordosis
- What other investigations for DMD?
    - **Bloods** - Elevated CK
    - Muscle **Biopsy**: absent dystrophin
    - **EMG** - Myopathic EMG
- What is Duchennes Muscular Dystrophy?
    - Genetic defect resulting in Absence of protein dystrophin
    - XL-linked recessive
- What is **Spinal Muscle Atrophy**? What gene?
    - Loss of Survival Motor Neuron gene (SMN 1), severity determined by levels of SMN 2
    - **AR**
- What is Becker’s Muscular dystrophy?
    - XLR also but **reduced** dystrophin (not absent like in DMD)
- Which patients with DMD will get scoliosis?
    - **100%** incidence once non ambulatory
    - Steroid treatment has reduced incidence (20% vs 92%)
        - 6/30 (20%) treated with steroids developed scoliosis and had surgery
        - 22/24 (92%) not treated with steroids (Lebel et al. JBJS 2013)
- What are the indications for surgery in DMD spine?
    - 30/30 rule - Earlier = less rigid curve = easier correction = less blood loss
    - > 30 degrees because once > 30 °, progression is 100%
    - FVC < 30 ° is an **contraindication** for surgery (Do before pulmonary function worsens , 30 °)
- Management options?
    - **Fusion vs Growing Rods**
    - Growing Rods if young age < 10yo whereby fusion results in restrictive lung disease as child grows
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2024.png)
        
- Indications of growing rods?
    - For children who develop severe scoliosis at a very young age (< 10 years) whereby spinal fusion may result in restrictive lung disease as child grows
- What is the principle of growing rods?
    - Short fusions of the spine at upper and lower ends with rods connecting them
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2025.png)
        
    - Periodically lengthened every 6 months to maintain growth
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2026.png)
        
    - VEPTR (Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib) is similar with fixation proximally on ribs instead of spine.
- What are the options after graduating from growing rods?
    - Assess for fusion - can do CT scan
    - 3 options:
        - Leave in-situ if spine is fused
        - Convert to posterior instrumentation and fusion at maturity
        - Remove without posterior instrumentation and fusion
- Special considerations in DMD scoliosis surgery?
    - **Bleeding**. Patients with DMD tend to bleed more during surgery than other types of scoliosis (even compare to SMA)
    - Because children with DMD lack dystrophin in all muscles types including smooth muscle, the excessive blood loss may be because of poor vasular smooth muscle vaso-constrictive response

    - Hip-Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthoses to help with gait. Works like a GRAFO

### NEUROFIBROMATOSIS SCOLIOSIS

- What are the types of Neurofibromatosis scoliosis?
    - Dystrophic vs Non-dystrophic curves based on absence or presence of skeletal dysplasia
    - Non dystrophic curves - similar to idiopathic curves
- Is neurological deficit common in NF-1 scoliosis?
    - No. Only about 17% of NF scoliosis has neurological deficit due to tumor or deformity.
- What investigations?
    - MRI
    - MRI can identify vertebral dysplasia in 36% of NF-1 patients initially classified on XR as non-dystrophic curves
    - MRI is needed to exclude underlying intraspinal pathology
- ‼️ What are the dystrophic features for NF curves?
    - Vertebral scalloping
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2028.png)

    - Rib pencilling
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2030.png)
        
    - Short curves with apical rotation
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2031.png)
        
    - Spindling of transverse processes
    - Wedging of one or more vertebral bodies
    - Paraspinal or intrapsinal soft tissue masses
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2032.png)
        
    - The more severe the dystrophic changes, the higher the likelhood of progression
- Management of non-dystrophic curves?
    - Non-dystrophic curves can be managed similarly to idiopathic scoliosis and demonstrate comparable response to treatment -
        - < 25 - monitor
        - > 25 - bracing
        - > 40 - consider surgery
- Management of dystrophic curves?
    - Should be treated **aggresssively**
    - Brace is **ineffective**
    - **Early spinal fusion** does not lead to loss of trunk height since the developing curves are usually short-segment, with limited growth potential. Therefore, loss of height should be anticipated if the deformity is allowed to progress rather than if premature fusion is performed.
    - < 20 ° - observe 6 monthly
    - 20 - 40 ° - posterior spinal fusion
    - > 40 ° - may require additional anterior fusion
- NF-1 Cervical spine involvement?
    - Kyphosis is the most common deformity occurring in the cervical spine
    - Often can result from previous excision of intra-spinal tumours which necessitated resection of laminae

## Congenital Scoliosis

- What are the maternal risk factors?
    - Similar to those in spinal bifida - maternal alchohol, folic acid deficient, anti-paralytic meds
- ‼️ What is it associated with?
    - VACTERL
- How is it different from idiopathic scoliosis?
    - Congenital Scoliosis is due to abnormalities in vertebral development. Idiopathic, no cause can be determined
    - Not amenable to bracing
    - Congenital scoliosis is associated with spinal cord abnormalities
    - CS is associated with systemic syndromes  - **VACTERL, Klippel Feil**
- What other investigations?
    - XR
    - CT with 3D recon
    - MRI for neural axis spinal dysraphism
    - Renal US, Echocardiogram
- ‼️ Types of congenital scoliosis?
    - Can be described as failure of **segmentation**, **formation**, or **hybrid**
    - **Segmentation** problem
        - Block - bilateral fusion
        - Unilateral bar
    - **Formation** problem -
        - Hemivertebrae and its variations (one pedicle)
            - Fully segmented (65%) - has normal disc above and below
            - Semi-segmented (22%) - fused to one neighbouring vertebrae and an open disc space other side.
            - Nonsegmented / incacerated (12%) - fused to both sides with no intervening disc space between adjacent vertebrae
        - Wedge vertebrae
    - **Hybrid** = Unilateral bar + hemivertebrae (20%)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2033.png)
        
- What is the most common type of congenital scoliosis?
    - Hemivertebrae; failure of formation
- What determines the severity of the congenital scoliosis?
    - **Type** - Hemivertebrae + unilateral bar has the worst
    - **Location** - junctional deformities (thoracolumbar or lumbosacral) will have most deformity
- Which has the worse prognosis for progression?
    - 1. **Worst** = Unilateral bar with hemivertebrae
    - 2. Unilateral bar
    - 3. Fully segmented hemivertebrae - steady progression
    - 4. Partially segmented hemivertebra - may slowly progress
    - **Non segmented/ incacerated** = little progression
    - **Best =** Block vertebrae
- What are the surgical options?
    - Hemivertebrae resection + short segment fusion
    - Hemi-epiphysiodesis on the convex side
    - Growing rods

## Infantile Scoliosis

- 90% resolve
- What is the most common direction?
    - **Left** thoracic 75%
- What investigations?
    - MRI is needed - 20% present with neuroaxial abnormalities.
    - MRI TRO tethered cord
- ‼️ What special angle?
    - Rib Vertebrae Angle Difference aka Mehta angle
    - Angle between the perpendicular line from APICAL VERTEBRAE endplate and rib, comparing both sides
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2034.png)
        
    - Look for overlap of the rib and vertebral body. Overlap = rib phase 2 = non resolving curve
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2035.png)
        
- ‼️ What are the predictors of progression in infantile scoliosis?
    - **3 predictors:**
        - Cobb **> 20**
        - Rib Vertebrase Angle Difference (Aka Mehta angle) **> 20**
        - Rib vertebrae **overlap** (Rib Phase 2)
- Management of infantile scoliosis?
    - Cobb < 25, RVAD < 20 = Observation
    - Cobb < 35, RVAD >20 = **Mehta Serial Casting** and Bracing
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2036.png)
        
    - Cobb > 50 = Op - VEPTR (Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR))or Growing Roads

## Adult Spinal Scoliosis

- What are 2 possibilities when you see an adult spine deformity? How to differentiate?
    - Residual idiopathic scoliosis vs De-Novo degenerative scoliosis
    - Differentiate by: De-novo usually in **lumbar spine and smaller magnitude**
- What are the clinical issues?
    - Radiculopathy and neurogenic claudication due to nerve root compression
        - Most commonly compression at concavity of curve
    - LBP
    - Affects sitting balance, may need hands - "hand dependant seater"
    - Rib impingement into ilium - pain, difficult hygeine
    - Swallowing difficulties
    - Respiratory complications
    - Pressure sores
- What lines are you measuring on the XR?
    - **Coronal**
        - Cobb angles
        - Coronal balance
            - If CSVL and C7PL coincide = balanced spine
                
                ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2037.png)
                
    - Sagittal - SVA, Pelvic measurements, lumbar lordosis
        - Sagittal Vertical Axis – **Plumbline from C7 VB** – this should pass through posterior 1/3 of the superior end plate of S1 (Normal is **within 5mm** )
            
            ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2038.png)
            
        - Lumbar Lordosis - from L1 superior end plate to L5 inferior end plate
            
            ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2039.png)
            
    - **Pelvic indices**
        - **PI = PT + SS**
- ‼️ ⚠️ How do you classify ASD?
    - Based on coronal curve types and 3 sagittal modifiers (Pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis, SVA, PT)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2040.png)
        
- What are the indications of surgical correction?
    - > 50 deg, sagittal imbalance, cardiopulmonary decline, intractable pain

- What are the surgical goals for this patient with adult spinal deformity?
    - Based on **Schwab et al. - 3 goals** (bascially the optimal sagittal modifier values)
        - SVA < 5cm
        - PI - LL < 10 deg [to achieve spinopelvic harmony]
        - Pelvic tilt. < 20
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%2041.png)
        
- What is the most reliable predictor of clinical symptoms in ASD?
    - **Saggital Vertical Axis**
    - Because it is the most reliable predictor of clinical symptoms - Glassman et al. 2005, Schwab et al. 2009
    - The most efficient way to accomplish this goal is to increase lumbar lordosis through anterior lengthening (interbody spacers) or to shorten the posterior column (pedicle subtraction osteotomy).
- What is the surgical strategy?
    - Long posterior construct
    - Prox. = neutral vertebrae (no rotation)
    - Dist. = L5/ S1
    - Correct sagittal deformities with osteotomies to achieve goals sagittal goals
    - KIV anterior release if extremely rigid curves
- What are the challenges in degen scoliosis vs idiopathic scoliosis?
    - **Patient Factors**
        - Co-morbids
        - Elderly - osteoporosis - pre op, intra and post op optimization
    - **Disease Factors**
        - Has more kyphosis - Need to restore sagittal balance with osteotomies to correct kyphosis
        - More rigid curves - higher risk of pull out during reduction - may need more use of multiaxial screws to help with reduction and pedicle screw techniques
