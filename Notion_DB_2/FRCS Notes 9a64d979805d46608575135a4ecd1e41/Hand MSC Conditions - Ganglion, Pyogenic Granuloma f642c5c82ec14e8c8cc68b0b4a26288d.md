### Pyogenic Granuloma (#❌ )

![Untitled](Hand%20MSC%20Conditions%20-%20Ganglion,%20Pyogenic%20Granuloma%20f642c5c82ec14e8c8cc68b0b4a26288d/Untitled.png)

- What is pyogenic granuloma?
    - Benign vascular proilferation.
- Classic description?
    - “Friable contact bleeding”
- Etiology of pyogenic granuloma?
    - Exact etiology unknown
    - May be secondary to minor trauma, chronic wounds
- What is the histology?
    - “Lobular capillary hemangioma”
- What is the management of pyogenic granuloma?
    - Surgical excision with primary closure
    - In clinic, you can shave of the lump, then cauterise the stalk with silver nitrate
    - According to Jinxi, the stalk is usually very narrow after you shave off the lump.

### Wrist Ganglion (#❗️❗️ )

- ‼️ ⚠️ What is a ganglion?
    - A ganglion is a **mucin-filled** **synovial cyst** with **no true epithelial lining** that arises from the tendon sheath or joint capsule
    - It is NOT a true cyst as it does not have an epithelial lining
- Most common locations of wrist ganglion?
    - 70% **dorsal** - from SL ligament (can look quite proximal)
    - 20% **Volar** wrist Ganglion - From radio-scaphoid, scapholunate, STT ot Metacarpotrapezial joint. [Higher recurrence rate than dorsal ganglion]

    - 10% **Flexor sheath** ganglion - arises from A1 or A2 pulleys ➔ these **do not move** with finger flexion
- Management of wrist ganglion?
    - Observation
    - Aspiration - risk of recurrence is 50%
    - Excision - risk of recurrence is **5%** - must remove entire stalk to prevent reaccumulation
- ⚠️ Any difference in outcomes from various treatment options for **VOLAR** wrist ganglion cyst?
    - [VOLAR Cysts] **Leicester Dias JHS 2007** - prospective cohort study of **182 patients**
        - **No difference in symptoms regardless whether ganglion was excised, aspirated or left alone at 2 - 5 year follow up.**
        - At **5 years**, no difference in recurrence rate between aspiration or excision (47 vs 42%)
        - At 5 years, 53% of untreated ganglion disappeared

- How do you excise a dorsal wrist ganglion?
    - **Transverse** skin incisions preferred
    - Identify **pedicle** and excise surrounding joint capsule
    - Do not close joint capsule
- How do you excise a volar wrist ganglion?
    - Check **Allens test** before surgery - to see involvement of radial artery, need to be careful in excision
