## Meniscus tears

- What are the meniscus tears associated with ACL injury?
    - LM tear more common in acute ACL
    - MM tear more common in chronic ACL
- MM or LM tear worse prognosis?
    - **LM tear** Because LM occupies more of the lateral tibial plateau (70% vs 50%)
    - Lateral tibial plateau more convex while medial is concave! ➔ **natural tendency to point loading** and increased contact stresses
- Classic signs on MRI?
    - Bucket handle tear = double PCL
- How can you classify tears?
    - Mechanism - traumatic or degenerative
    - Morphology
        - Bucket handle tear (locking, a/w with high grade laxity)
        - Vertical, radial tear
        - Horizontal Cleavage tears – usually degenerative, a/w cyst
    - Chronicity
- What are the indications for surgery for **DEGENERATIVE TEAR**?
    - My decision will be based on the **ESKKA** meniscus Consensus group **2016** depending on the response to conservative management and presence of OA to decide on "Arthroscopic partial Menisectomy (APM)"
    - If age **> 35 yo**, NON locked but painful knee > 1 month ➔ XR
    - MRI is not indicated in first line of work up
    - Trial of conservative for **at least 3 months before MRI**
    - If still symptomatic ➔ depends on XR or MRI findings of OA
        - If **OA = NO ARTHROSCOPIC DEBRIDEMENT** but treat as OA
        - If no OA = offer **arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM)**
    - CONSIDER - **realignment surgery** if mal-alignment present

- How about TRAUMATIC tears?
    - PATIENT and INJURY factors
    - Patient - age, activity level, alignment
    - Tear - bucket handle with mechanical block, location of tear, associated ligament injury
- What surgical techniques do you know? Which part of meniscus use what?
    - **Inside-out (gold standard)** = Needles go from inside out
        - Creation of windows of safety on both sides - "both are actually Anterior to the gastroc and hamstring muscles"
        - Medial window is "anterior to both the Pes and to the medial gastroc muscles"
            - Longitudinal incision medially, dissect anterior to the Pes. With knee in flexion, retract the Pes posterior (protecting saphenous nerve), go **deep to the medial head of the gastroc** and insert protector
                - Posterior wall = gastroc
                - Anterior wall = Posteromedial capsule
                - Inferior wall = Pes Anserinus

        - Lateral window is "anterior to the biceps femoris, and lateral head of gastroc"
            - Incision posterior border of ITB, incise ITB, Blunt dissection anterior to lateral gastric head and posterolateral capsule
            
            ![Untitled](Meniscus%20Injuries,%20Discoid%20ed4730544f294fe591d31aaa9ef7a8fc/Untitled%203.png)
            
    - **Outside-in** = needles go from outside to in
        
        ![Untitled](Meniscus%20Injuries,%20Discoid%20ed4730544f294fe591d31aaa9ef7a8fc/Untitled%204.png)
        
        - Economical
        - Good for anterior horn repairs
    - **All-inside**
        - +: easy
        - Vs Inside out?
            - No difference! (Elmallah et al. Meta-anaylsis)
- How can you optimise healing?
    - Rasping and shavers to freshen both sides “synovial abrasion”
    - Trephination of meniscus with spinal needle
    - Autologous blood clot
    - **Fibrin clot Augmentation** (draw blood, stir to get clot, shape clot, implant clot)
    - Stem cell, PRP
- What is your post op instructions for meniscus tear?
    - I will NWB x 6/52
    - Aware that no consensus on WB status (Robert Sprang et al. Systematic review)
    - Perkins et al. 2017 for vertical tear repairs – immediate WB vs NWB with flexion > 90 deg ➔ no difference in reop rates
    - Radial tears – 6/52 NWB to prevent retear
- What are the outcomes of repair? A/w with ACL recon?
    - "better with concomittant ACL recon"
    - **90%** in conjunction with ACL recon (drilling produces releases healing factors)
    - **60%** w/o ACL recon
    - 30% if ACL deficient and not reconstructed
- What are **ramp tears**?
    - Disruption of the **posteromedial meniscocapsular** junction
        
        ![Untitled](Meniscus%20Injuries,%20Discoid%20ed4730544f294fe591d31aaa9ef7a8fc/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - A/W ACL tears. Dave Lee says usually seen if doing early ACL recon. If delayed, it usually is healed and stable
- What are perimeniscal cysts? How to manage?
    - A/w Horizontal flap tears due to one way valve
    - Technique: **Haybale** stitches to repair horizontal tear

## MENISCAL ROOT TEARS

- What are root tears?
    - Radial tear within 1cm from meniscus attachment OR bony root avulsion
- Significance of root tears?
    - Biomechanically comparable to a total meniscectomy due to compromised hoop stresses
- What are the different etiology of LM or MM root tears?
    - LM due to trauma
    - MM due to degenerative
    - A/w SONK – **80% of SONK has medial root tear**. Usually MM tear first then excess loading on the tibia plateau ➔ SONK
- What are the MRI findings of root tears?
    - Coronal: Meniscus extrusion > 3mm; Linear high sinal

    ![Untitled](Meniscus%20Injuries,%20Discoid%20ed4730544f294fe591d31aaa9ef7a8fc/Untitled%208.png)
    
- Surgical Management of root tears?
    - Transtibial pull out technique (with tibia tunnel)
    - Suture Anchor technique
- Do Meniscus extrusion only occur in meniscal root tears?
    - No.
    - For extrusion > 3mm,
        - 65% were from medial posterior horn tears,
        - 21% medial body tears,
        - 5% medial root tears
        - 9% lateral body tears
        - 4% lateral posterior horn tears

## MENISCAL TRANSPLANT

- Who is suitable for meniscal transplant?
    - Selected patients with meniscus deficiency to reduce contact stress in knee
    - **No OA, Normal alignment (or corrected), Stable knee**
    - Success 10 year survival 80%
- What techniques for meniscal transplant?
    - 1. **Bone block** technique [American technique]
        - Stone et al. Arthroscopy 2003. ‘Three tunnel technique”. 3 tunnels anchored from anterior root, posterior root and posteromedial corner of meniscus
    - 2. **Soft tissue only** transplant (technically easier) [European technique]
        - Transtibial tunnels for anterior and posterior root
        - Mixture of inside-out and all inside sutures to attach body of meniscus
    - 3. **Dovetail** technique (variation of bone block that contains both anterior and posterior horn)
        - Slot of bone containing both anterior and posterior horns attached
            
            ![Untitled](Meniscus%20Injuries,%20Discoid%20ed4730544f294fe591d31aaa9ef7a8fc/Untitled%209.png)
            
        - For Lateral meniscus as the insertions are nearer to each other
- What post op rehab?
    - NWB x 1/12, PWB x 1/12 then FWB
    - 1st 2 week locked in extension, then 0-90 for next 4 weeks. Then FROM
    - No squatting for 6 weeks; no running for 9 months
