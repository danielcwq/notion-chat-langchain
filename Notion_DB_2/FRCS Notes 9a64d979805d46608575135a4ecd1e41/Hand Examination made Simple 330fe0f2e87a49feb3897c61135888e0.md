# Hand Exam made Simple

<aside>
üëã Master the Look screening moves. Because it calms your nerves if you have something to do for the first 30 seconds.

</aside>

### LOOK/ SCREENING

- **Palms Down (most natural starting position for patient)** look for conditions
    - Ulnar nerve - 1st webspace wasting, guttering of fingers
    - Ask patient to close fingers - Assess for wartenberg
    - Look for - herbeden, bochards,
    - RA deformities
- **Palms up** - look for conditions. + Scars along volar aspect of forearm and arm
    - Median nerve - thenar wasting, scars at CT
    - Ulnar nerve - hypothenar wasting, scar at guyon, clawing, wartenberg's sign
    - Attitude of fingers - Dupuytren
    - RA deformities
- **Lift up, Open Close, wrist cock up + sagittal profile + Wrist ROM + Elbows up to look at posterior elbow and arm**
    - Look for drop fingers, triggering, contractures
    - No wrist drop
- **Palms up open and close**
    - Triggering/ contractures
    - Finger attitude
- **Quick Screen of nerves**
    - Thumbs up, Abduction, Criss cross
    - Sensation at thumb, little finger tips and 1st web space
- "At this point, i note that there is...."

# Undergrad Cases

### 1. Median nerve ‚ûî

- "There are signs suggestive of a median nerve palsy, will go on to examine to confirm and determine level of compression"
- Sensation x 2
    - Check tip of thumb sensory loss
    - Check thenar eminence sensory (palmar cutaneous nerve)
- Muscle x 5 in sequence [F. Ali]

    - High median nerve -
        - Check **Abductor Digiti Minimi** (Hubber) and **EIP** [Cannot use PL]
        - FDP 4,5 for finger flexion
        - BR for FPL function

### 2. Ulnar nerve ‚ûî

- "There are signs suggestive of a ULNAR nerve palsy, will go on to examine to confirm and determine level of compression"
- **Check Elbow ROM - flexion extension for Elbow OA!**
- Sensation x 2

    - Evaluate Claw fixed or flexible - Bouvier's test
        - **Bouvier** test - FLex MCPJ, Check  ACTIVE Extension of DIPJ and PIPJ
            - What is the **Bouvier test** for claw/ intrinsic minus hand?
                - Bouvier test is an **active** test to evaluate the **integrity of the extensor mechanism** in a claw hand. it can then be classified into "simple" or "complex"
                - When passive correction of the MCP hyperextension allows the patient to extend the interphalangeal joints with the integrity of the extensor mechanism (Positive Bouvier¬¥s test), the claw deformity is classified as a **simple claw hand**.
                - When the patient cannot actively extend the proximal interphalangeal joints after passive MCP hyperextension correction, extensor mechanism impairment exists (Negative Bouvier¬¥s test), and deformity is classified as a **complex** claw hand.

![Untitled](Hand%20Examination%20made%20Simple%20330fe0f2e87a49feb3897c61135888e0/Untitled%204.png)

- Things to comment on inspection
    - Squaring and shouldering of thumb CMCJ with hyperextended MCPJ and adducted thumb MC
    - Shoulder of CMCJ
    - Wasting of thenar muscles - can be due to disuse atrophy of thumb

    - Check **FCR** tendon - for LRTI

### 9. Dupuytren's Song

- [LOOK + SCREENING]
    - Note the presence of nodules, cords and pitting of along the ring finger, concerns of Duputryen's disease
    - Before I proceed, will go on to screen the hand for other concomittant pathologies
    - Dorsum - Garrod's pads
    - Palm - scars
    - "At this point, the goal of my assessment are 2 fold"
        - Look for signs of Dupuytren's Diasthesis - aggressive disease
        - Look for indications for surgery
    - Before I go on, can i ask you a few questions?
        - How old when these started? < 40 yo
        - Any family history?
        - Any similar condition in penis and foot?
        - "I also note this is on the ring finger, not radial sided"
        - As such this patient do not have signs of dupuytren's diasthesis
- [FEEL] "I will go on to FEEL your hand"
    - Feel each finger
    - Starting from thumb - no cords along FPL, no comissure cords
    - Feel the affected finger from palm
        - Central of palm and finger - pre-tendinous cords from the MCPJ down to the proximal phalanx
        - DIPJ - "No DIPJ retrovascular cords"
        - Lateral aspects of finger - "lateral or spiral cords"
        - Web spaces - "Natatory cords"
    - Evaluate ROM by:
        - Checking PIPJ with flexion of the MCPJ

    - Measure fixed flexion deformities at MCP joint and the PIP joint using a goniometer. **PIPJ > 15, MCPJ > 30**
        - Need to measure with both MCPJ flexed and extended.
            - If when flexed, PIPJ fully extends, then we know we just need to address the cord
            - if when flexed, PIPJ still contracted, then it is due to joint capsule
            
            ![Untitled](Hand%20Examination%20made%20Simple%20330fe0f2e87a49feb3897c61135888e0/Untitled%205.png)

            - Scaphoid Shift Test aka Kirk Watson's Test for SL ligament
                - Grab wrist, thumb on scaphoid tubercle
                - Move patient hand from ulnar to radial deviation whilst maintaining pressure on scaphoid tubercle
                - With radial deviation, scaphoid usually flexes but this is prevented by the thumb ‚Üí so the scaphoid subluxes dorsally off the radius
                - Positive - pain / click
                
                ![Untitled](Hand%20Examination%20made%20Simple%20330fe0f2e87a49feb3897c61135888e0/Untitled%206.png)

- Look
    - Prominent **ulna head noted**
    - Scars in forearm (previous galeazzi)
- Standard screen
- + **Check Forearm pronation supination** - may be limited in osteochondroma, madelung
- ‚ÄúI note that there is prominence of the ulna, would like to proceed to identify the cause of this‚Äù
    - Palpating the forearm - do not note any lumps to suggest forearm osteochondromas, ideally look at other parts of body
- Evaluate the **TFCC** now
    - Focus on TFCC - do the 4 tests for TFCC

- My Prominent ulnar head
    - TFCC unstable ‚ûî TFCC injury with PL intact for recon if required
    - TFCC is stable ‚ûî differentials for deformity is Madelung disease or forearm osteochondroma (less likely no lumps felt)

### 13. Congenital Hand - Radial Club hand + Thumb Hypoplasia

- Look and describe
    - Radial deviation of the wrist
    - Absent thumb
- ‚Äúthis is Radial club hand with thumb hypoplasia, I will go on to examine for function and related deformities‚Äù
    - Elbow - stiff elbow (contraindication for correction)/ flexible
    - Thumb
        - Evaluate level
        - Evaluate MCPJ and CMCJ stability
        - Web space contractures
- Check function
    - Ask for handedness,
    - Demonstrate how he picks up things, write and pick up coin

    - **[Dominance]** On inspection, the ulnar duplicate appears to be bigger.
        - ‚Äúcomparing to the contralateral thumb and ipsilateral index finger, it is almost similar in size
        - Nails are well formed
    - ‚Äúopen close the wrist‚Äù - on making a fist, it appears that the ulnar duplicate if the dominant duplicate
    - ‚Äúpick up this key‚Äù - i note that the patient is using his ulnar duplicate - suggesting that is the dominant one.
    - [Level] WIth regards to the level, it seems to be from the PIPJ
    - Look for angular deofrmity
- For each duplicate:
    - Check tendons - FPL, EPL
    - Check sensation
    - Check digital allens test for each duplicate, Cap refill
    - Check **stability** of each joint in each duplicate
- Check **Web space** for contractures
- Check **Kapanji** score - can also help with seeing dominance
- Check Function

### 15. Syndactyly

- noted Syndactyly. Complete screen. Check NV digital Allen, sensation of each nerve, check function
- no constriction bands proximally
- elbow rom good - no arthrogryposis
- look for associated conditions
- request take off shirt - look for missing peg major in Poland, Sprengel shoulder in Poland, look at other
- No syndrome feature in face to suggest apert's.
