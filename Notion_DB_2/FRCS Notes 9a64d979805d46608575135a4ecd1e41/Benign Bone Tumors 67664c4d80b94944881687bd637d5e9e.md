        - Group 1 = Curretage with high speed burr + cement - 44% recurrence
        - Group 2 = + Adjuvant (nitrogen, peroxide or Phenol)
        - Group 3 = Wide resection only
        - No recurrence with group 2. **All recurrences were Campanacci Grade 2 or 3**
- Why do you choose cement vs bone graft?
    1. Heat necrosis of cells
    2. Stability
    3. Easier to identify recurrence later 
    
    (-) never gets integrated unlike bone graft
    
- What if GCT is close to breaching the joint and want to preserve joint?
    - Preoperative RANKL inhibitor **Denosumab** can be used as a neoadjuvant therapy [CONTROVERSIAL]
    - However, it does pose a new challenge in delineating the true extent of the tumor. Authors suggest curettage and burring should be even more thorough following denosumab treatment

- How do you treat the GCT lung metastases?
    - No clear consensus in literature
    - Lung mets do not necessarily need to be excised
        - Studies show only 50% progressed
        - First line can be to monitor, excise if progression
        - Can treat with denosumab

- Role of Denosumab? **[DO NOT MENTION IN EXAM. V CONTROVERSIAL]**
    - [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2309499020979750](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2309499020979750)
    - **Neoadjuvant denosumab** in patients with advanced GCTB for cases who were not candidates for primary curettage initially, and
    - Prolonged use for surgically **unsalvageable** GCTB.
    - **Adjuvant setting** to prevent recurrence is not established.
    - **As adjuvant:** Recent systematic review shows positive clinical response in terms of Pain relief but recurrence rates and oncological outcomes same. But has many adverse events - ostenocrosis of jaw, AFF.

- Role of Bisphosphonates in GCT?
    - Controversial as they target osteoclasts and not stromal cells which is the cause of the problem.
- Surgical Management of GCT algorithm (SOA)

- Description of Enchondroma
    - L - metaphyseal
    - R - narrow, no periosteal reaction
    - M - chondroid, popcorn calcification
- What is the pathophysiology?
    - Cartilage escaping from physis and displacing into metaphysis and proliferating there
- What are multiple enchondromatosis?
    - **Ollier's** disease - Sporadic inheritance. Risk of malignancy < 30%
    - **Maffucci's** syndrome - Sporadic inheritance. RIsk of malignancy 100%
        - Multiple angiomas - round, calcified phleboliths
        - Risk of GI cancer - pancreatic cancer, biliary adenocarcinoma
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What is the malignant risk for enchondromas?
    - Solitatory - < 1%
    - Ollier's - 30%
    - Maffucci - 100%
- Macrosopic features during excision?
    - **Blue gray, lobulated hyaline cartilage**, with scattered calcifications.
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What kind of cartilage is enchondroma?
    - Hyaline cartilage (same as osteochondroma)
- What is always a **differential diagnosis**?
    - Low grade chondrosarcoma
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è If there is a risk of low grade CS, then when do we need to do MRI? What XR feature is worrying?
    - Clinical features of - inflammatory pain,
    - XR - involvement of cortex with endosteal scalloping
    - Should consider MRI with contrast and Bone scan to see if uptake more than Anterior Superior Iliac Crest
    
    [JO2016-8262079.pdf](Benign%20Bone%20Tumors%2067664c4d80b94944881687bd637d5e9e/JO2016-8262079.pdf)

- When do we need intralesional curretage and biopsy?
    - Based on paper - pain red flag, MRI showing cortical involvement (endosteal scalloping), Bone scan showing more uptake than Anterior Superior Iliac Crest (ASIC)
    - Large lesions at risk for fracture or suspicion of malignant change (Low grade chondrosarcoma)
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è If require currettage, how will you do so?
    - Stand by Frozen Section with Pathology
    - Intralesional curettage send for frozen and wait for results
        - If it is **Enchondroma**, proceed with bone grafting and adjuvants
        - If it is **Chondrosarcoma**, then treat accordingly.

    - L - Metaphyseal-diaphyseal
    - A - Cortical thinning and expansion
    - R - narrow, no periosteal reaction
    - M - chondroid
- Usually which finger?
    - Usually on the ulnar sided digit P1 and MC

    ![Untitled](Benign%20Bone%20Tumors%2067664c4d80b94944881687bd637d5e9e/Untitled%2042.png)
    
    - I will do a **"Staged approach"**
    - **Stage 1** - Splint in short ulnar gutter splint for 4/52 and when pain better, start gentle ROM
        - When **outer periosteum healed** at 3/12 ‚ûî it will not heal like bone cyst!
    - **Stage 2** go in for curretage and bone graft (cancellous bone graft from dorsal of distal radius)
        - **midaxial lateral approach** so that no need compromise tendon
        - Create **hole in periosteum**, curretage entire lesion
        - II guidance to curretage lesion with bone graft
        - Splint for another 1/12 to allow healing then ROM
        - Aim splint off at 2/12
    - *Enchondromas don‚Äôt act as same way as bone cysts. They do not heal up after fracture. Will need bone grafting

### Chondromyxoid Fibroma (#‚ùå ) - commonly discussed with Chondroblastoma (similar pathology)

    - R: narrow zone, no periosteal reaction
    - M: chondroid
- Extremely rare - < 0.5% of tumors
- Management of CMF?
    - Aggressive like Chondroblastoma
    - Intralesional Curretage and bone grafting
