### AVN Hip

- ‼️⚠️  Risk factors/ Causes of Hip AVN?
    - Most common causes up to 90% reported are associated with alchohol and steroids
    - **Idiopathic**
    - **Secondary** -
        - **intravascular** factors -
            - Systemic disease
                - **SLE** causing vasculitis and venous outflow issues ➔ increased intraosseous pressure
                - **Sicke cell anemia** ➔ abnormal shaped RBC obstruct blood flow
                - **Radiation** ➔ vasculitis
                - **Hyperlipidmia, Alchohol** ➔ theorized to increase lipid levels
                - Caisson's decompression disease (release of nitrogen gas bubbles into body)
        - Extra-vascular causes -
            - EXTRAOSSEOUS
                - Trauma disrupting blood supply - NOF #, talus #
                - Tamponade of blood supply - compressive causes
            - INTRAOSSEOUS
                - Steroids leading to fat hypertrophy and increased intraooseous pressure
- ‼️ ⚠️ Natural history of AVN? Risk factors of collapse?
    - Systematic review by Michael Mont et al. **59%** of patients with asymptomatic AVN progress to symptomatic disease which usually due to  **collapse of femoral head**
    - **3 Risk factors** according to Michael mont et al.
        - 1. **Etiology**.
            - **Sickle cell highest** 73% > Alcohol 47% > Renal failure 46%  > Idiopathic 38% > Steroids 26% … Lowest is SLE 7%
        - 2. **Size of lesion** - this paper did not use Kerboul angles but utilized MRI volumetric calculation of head involvement
            - **>25 %** involvement - increased risk of collapse
        - 3. **Involvement of weight bearing area** (lateral 2/3 of weight bearing portion of femoral head)
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the pathogenesis of AVN Hip?
    - **Ischemic Phase** of which the final pathway is the presence of micro-emboli ➔ stasis ➔ incresased intraosseous pressure ➔ decreased blood flow ➔ AVN ➔ collapse
    - **Reparative phase** reactive hyperemia, ingrowth of vascular tissue ➔ **creeping substitution** of dead bone and new born formation
    - Specific etiologies
        - Sickle cell, SLE can cause micro emboli
        - Steroids and Alcohol causes elevated lipid levels
        - Renal failure - Pathogenesis in CRF unclear.
- What percentage is bilateral?
    - Up to 80%!
- How does steroid cause AVN?
    - 2 mechanisms
        - 1. Theory is that fat cell hypertrophy within bone marrow increases femoral head pressure ➔ sinusoidal vascular collapse ➔ necrosis of femoral head.
        - 2. Also, intravascular hyperlipidemic state
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the classification of AVN?
    - **Steinberg** Classifx
    - 0 = XR normal, no pain
    - 1 = MRI +
    - 2 = XR increased density (Sclerosis)
    - 3 = Crescent sign = subchondral collapse WITHOUT flattening
        
        ![Untitled](AVN%20Hip%20ITOH%20BMES%20OA%20Hip%200f2feefb8d724811bb0d04f0546182d2/Untitled.png)
        
    - 4 = **Flattening** of femoral head (4 for flattening)
    - 5 = OA w/o acetabulum
    - 6 = involve acetabulum
- FICAT is a XR classifx - FICAT 3 = Steinberg 4
    
    ![Untitled](AVN%20Hip%20ITOH%20BMES%20OA%20Hip%200f2feefb8d724811bb0d04f0546182d2/Untitled%201.png)
    

- How do you prognosticate if the AVN will collapse?
    - Initially described in 1974 - was XR calculation on AP and lateral XR (basically < or > than 200 °)
    - Ha 2006 JBJS modified to use MRI: (Modified Kerboul Angle)
    - Study of 37 hips, followed up for 3 years.
    - Combined necrotic angle on **mid-coronal and mid-sagittal cuts**.
        - **< 190** = low risk - non collapsed
        - **190 - 240** = moderate risk - 50% collapsed
        - **> 240 °** = high risk - all collapsed

- What special Radiology signs?
    - XR - Crescent sign
        
        ![Untitled](AVN%20Hip%20ITOH%20BMES%20OA%20Hip%200f2feefb8d724811bb0d04f0546182d2/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - MRI - double line sign - “Serpinginous line paralleled by inner and outer hyper intense line”
        
        ![Untitled](AVN%20Hip%20ITOH%20BMES%20OA%20Hip%200f2feefb8d724811bb0d04f0546182d2/Untitled%204.png)
        
- How will you treat AVN non operatively?
    - FWBAT/ PWBAT/ NWB no difference (Mont 1996 systematic review in CORR)
    - I will give analgesia, PT to maintain hip ROM, allow FWBAT, consider reduce high impact exercises
    - Bisphosphonates are controversial - i will not give. Group by Agarwala found good results but no other RCT has found good results
- ‼️ Role of bisphoshonates Alendronate in AVN?
    - No consensus.
    - Agarwala published in JBJS and JOA (Not RCT; no control group)on 8-10 year follow up studies. Found clinical improvement and potential delay to arthroplasty if given for 3 years
- What are the hip preserving options for pre-collapsed hip?
    - **Core decompression +/- strut grafting** with vascularised fibular graft or Tantalum Rod
        - Outcomes? Fairbank et al. Survival rates correspond to initial severity. for FICAT 1 - 90%; 2 - 66%; 3 - 23%. 50% progressed by 1 stage.
        - Different types of graft can be inserted
    - **Percutaneous Drilling**
        - Supine position ➔ II guidance ➔ 2-3 passess with 3mm steinmen pin
    - **Osteotomies**
        - ***Angular*** - Transtrochanteric Curved Varus Osteotomy (TCVO)/ Inter trochanteric Varus osteotomy
        - ***Rotational*** - Sugioka Transtrochanteric Rotational Osteotomy (TRO)
    - **Trapdoor procedure** by Mont et al. 1998
        - Lateral positon ➔ AL approach ➔ dislocate hip ➔ trap door made ➔ debride to bleeding bone ➔ Corticocancellous ICBG inserted ➔ trap door replaced
        - Monte used it for Ficat 3 with collapse
- How you do core decompression?
    - Insert wire to the collapsed area
    - Overdrill with reamer e.g. DHS reamer
    - Insert graft - which can be autograft or metal augment
    - PWB for 6/52 to prevent subtrochanteric fractures
- ‼️ What is the rationale of core decompression? (3)
    - To **decompress** intraosseous pressure
    - **Increase** blood flow
    - **Promote** healing response
- Any issues with tantalum rod?
    - Difficult to remove
    - Concerns of retained tantalum debris when doing conversion to THR, though, wear rates are not increased at 2 year follow up.

- Complications with vascularized fibula bone graft?
    - **Donor** site - **great toe flexion contracture (37%)**, ankle pain, sensory loss, infection
    - **Graft** site - pin migration, HO, fracture
    - Why great toe flexion contracture?
        - We believe that the loss of muscle origins due to fibular removal causes the contracture and a tenodesis effect of the long-toe flexor tendons.
        - Can be very subtle only seen when ankle fully dorsiflexed

- How will you do a hip replacement for patient with AVN?
    - Complex Primary
    - Pre Op
        - Templating - address LLD
        - Long leg films to determine LLD
        - Implants - plan for hybrid
        - Depending on etiology - Sickle Cell (stand by transfusion needs, cell saver)
    - Intraop
        - Approach - plan for extensile posterior approach
        - Expect stiffness ++ ➔ may need to release psoas, Gluteus maximus; insitu neck cut
        - Bone quality may be weaker ➔ careful rasping and broaching
    - Post Op
        - Standard FWBAT
- Concerns in sickle cell anemia?
    - Higher risks of infection and failure
    - Necrotic bone has limited potential for bone ingrowth ➔ use cemented implants
    - Soft areas of bone (due to bone marrow hyperplasia) mixed with areas of dense bone may lead to eccentric reaming and difficult cementless fixation of cup.

### Idiopathic Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip (ITOH)/ Bone Marrow Edema Syndrome (BMES)

![Untitled](AVN%20Hip%20ITOH%20BMES%20OA%20Hip%200f2feefb8d724811bb0d04f0546182d2/Untitled%205.png)

- Clinical presentation of ITOH/ BMES?
    - Progressive, atraumatic hip and groin pain
    - Usually affecting women in last trimester of pregnancy and middle ged men
- What are the XR findings?
    - May reveal localised diffuse osteopenia. There is no joint space narrowing, scalloping, collapse or fracture
- What are the MRI findings?
    - Heterogenous Bone marrow edema pattern
- How do you diagnose ITOH?
    - It is a diagnosis of exclusion
    - Need to exclude infection, malignancy, AVN
- Management of ITOH/ BMES?
    - Non operative
    - PWB to avoid stress fractures
    - Resolves spontaneously in 6-8 months

## OA Hip

- What is the classification of Hip OA?
    - OA changes classified with Tonnis Classification
    - Tonnis 0 = no OA
    - 1 = mild narrowing
    - 2 = Moderate = moderate narrowing
    - 3 = severe, large cysts, obliteration of joint space
