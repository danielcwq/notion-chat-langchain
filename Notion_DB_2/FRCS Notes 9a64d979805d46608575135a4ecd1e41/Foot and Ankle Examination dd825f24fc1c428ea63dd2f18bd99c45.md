## General Foot Ankle Sequence

- **[STANDING]**
    - Describe deformity systematically from hindfoot, mid foot and forefoot
- **[WALK]**
- **[STANDING TESTS]**
    - Pes Planus Tests = Tip Toe
        - hindfoot valgus ➔ tip toe both legs. if correctible then go to do single leg. if not correctible, dont bother
            - assess if correctible hindfoot
    - Pes Cavus Tests = Coleman Block
- **[SIT]** - cue to look at shoes, orthosis
    - Look around the room for orthosis, prosthesis, walking aid, shoe ➔ PICK up the shoe and look at the insole and any wedges
    - **Look** at foot plantar aspect - scars from neuroma excision, between toes
    - **Palpate** tendons and structures
        - Posterior tibialis tendon to navicular
        - Peroneal tendons to 5MT
        - Pes cavus feel - Lateral arch pain
        - pes plan us - feel Medial arch pain
        - Hallux valgus - feel toe
        - Hallux rigidus - feel toe
    - Assess **ROM**
        - **Ankle** ROM + Silverskoid test
            
            ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled.png)
            
        - **Subtalar** joint
            - Palpate both malleoli then shift forwards to hold talus in place
            - Test inversion and eversion
            
            ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%201.png)
            
        - **Chopart** joint
            - In order to remove proximal bones out of equation, one hand must immobilize the calcaneum
            - The other hand feel for navicular tuberosity then rotate TN joint in supination and pronation
                
                ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%202.png)
                
        - **Midfoot/ lisfranc joint** -
            - From earlier palpation of navicular joint, now immobilize the navicular
            - Then like a cross - abduct, adduct, dorsiflexion, planatar flexion
            
            ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%203.png)
            
        - **Big toe** - 1st TMTJ, 1st MTPJ, 1st IPJ
            
            ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%204.png)
            
    - **Palpate** Other things
        - Lesser toe deformities - check flexibility by pushing the forefoot in plantar and dorsiflexion to see if toes move by **tenodesis effect**
    - Check **Sensation**
        - Check DPN, saphenous nerves, sural, SPN, medial, lateral plantar nerves
            
            ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%205.png)
            
    - Check **Pulses**
    - Palpate and Check **tendon function and for transfers**
        - **Pes Planus** - PT weak, AT and **FDL** for transfers
        - **Pes Cavus** - AT and PB weak, PT and PL for transfers
- **Beighton** score for Pes Planus, Hallux Valgus
- Any deformity - 3 things
    - Rigid or flexible? correctibility
    - Complication of deformity - ulceration, callosities
    - Silferskoid test ➔ can worsen deformity e.g. by increase load on 1st MTPJ

## Common Scenarios

### ➔ Hallux Valgus

- Clear description of deformity
    - From **front** - 4 things about hallux valgus,
        - 1. Lateral deviation of big toe at MTPJ
        - 2. Prominence of MT head and Skin over medial border: thickened and hyperkeratotic, ulcerated(bunion)
        - 3. Varus deformity of 1 st MT
        - 4. Pronation of hallux (PP)
    - Describe the lesser toes: Overriding 2nd toe, HAMMER TOES
    - A/w with Pes Planus deformity and extra skin creases on lateral subfibula area suggesting hindfoot valgus and
    - From **side** - subfibular impingement
    - **Posteriorly** for any Hindfoot deformity, too many toes sign (valgus)
- Pes planus gait - loss of 3rd rocker with loss of propulsion with flat on ground contact
- Check ankle ROM with Silverskoid. No need subtalar, chopart or lisfranc
- Check TMTJ mobility
- Check Grind test
- Check NV and Dorsomedial cutaneous nerve!
- **Beighton** score

### **→** Hallux Rigidus [GOUT GOUT GOUT]

![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%206.png)

- Look - swelling over dorsum of 1st MTPJ
    - Risk factors - pes planus, hallux valgus
- **Gait** - walking on outer border (supinate foot on ambulation due to unable to push off properly)
    - Loss of third rocker in push off w great toe. No dorsiflexion of great toe
- **Sit** and **Look** -
    - **Shoes** - lateral shoe wear!
    - Foot - callus, transfer metatarsalgia calluses
- Assess ROM of MTPJ; range of tenderness - terminal vs mid ROM
- Assess **ROM of IPJ** - may affect decision for fusion (cannot fuse if IPJ is already stuff)
- Special test - grind test
- Neurovascular status!
    - May have numbness due to osteophyte impingement of dorsomedial cutaneous nerve
- Complete my exam by asking history TRO **Gout** in the 1st MTPJ

### ➔ Adult PTTD

- Description of inspection
    - From front "Patient has pes planus with supinated and abducted forefoot" ?associated mild hallux valgus?
    - From side "presence of skin creases on lateral aspect suggesting chronic subfibular impingement"
    - From back "Hindfoot valgus, too many toes sign". Presence of forefoot abduction/ too many toe signs (usually only see little toe. Too many toes = **see all 4 toes.**  = at least stage 2
    - Medially "suggestion of edema along Post tib tendon"
- Describe Gait = Flat on ground contact with loss of 3rd rocker lack of push off, consistent with loss of PTT function
- 2 Tests for flat feet
    - **1. Tip toe test**
        - Go to wall, tip toe both legs. if correctible then go to do single leg. if not correctible, dont bother [correctible means = stage 1/2; uncorrectible = stage 3 rigid]
            - assess if correctible hindfoot
            
            ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%207.png)
            
            ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%208.png)
            
    - **2. Jack's test =** Dorsiflex big toe should cause medial arch to elevate due to windlass effect if subtalar joint is flexible
    - *Principle of correctiblity*
        - If correctible = not rigid = stage 1/2
        - Determine stage 1/2 by check if can do single leg tip toe. If cannot do single leg = stage 2

### ➔ Paeds Rigid Flat Foot (Tarsal coalition)

- **1. Tip toe test**
    - Go to wall, tip toe both legs. if correctible then go to do single leg. if not correctible, dont bother [correctible means = stage 1/2; uncorrectible = stage 3 rigid]
        - assess if correctible hindfoot
        
        ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%207.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%208.png)
        
- **2. Jack's test =** Dorsiflex big toe should cause medial arch to elevate due to windlass effect if subtalar joint is flexible
- *Principle of correctiblity*
    - If correctible = not rigid = stage 1/2
    - Determine stage 1/2 by check if can do single leg tip toe. If cannot do single leg = stage 1

### ➔ Pes Cavus

- Clear description
    - Expose from calves and below
    - From front "Pes Cavus deformity with Peek a boo heels. Associated CLAW toes, big toe is hyperextended due to over-recruitment of EHL"
    - From side
    - From back "Hindfoot in varus, Wasting of muscles of lateral compartments - champagne bottle leg"
    - Medially "very high arch"
    - Describe deformity systematically from hindfoot, mid foot and forefoot
- LOOK AT **SPINE** IMMEDIATELY
- Gait
    - Presence of high stepping gait due to foot drop and weak anterior tibialis muscle
    - Presence of external rotation of the foot - classical of stiff ankle joint
    - Presence of broad based gait in CMT
- Pes Cavus - AT and PB weak, PT and PL for transfers
- Complete by looking at **hands** if CMT for dorsal guttering

### → Rheumatoid Foot

- Standing
    - Deformity ++
    - Fore foot deformities - Claw toes, hallux valgus, calluses
        
        ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - Loss of medial arch
    - Hindfoot - likely valgus with pes planus (Post tib could be ruptured from synovitis)
        
        ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Do not note Rheumatoid nodules at achilles tendon
        
        ![Untitled](Foot%20and%20Ankle%20Examination%20dd825f24fc1c428ea63dd2f18bd99c45/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- Walk - anthalgic, aids
- Standing tests
    - Bilateral tip toe -
        - to check for correctibility (unlikely)
        - Confirm with Jack’s test
- Sit
    - Check tendon functions
- Complete
    - Evaluate hands, hip, Cervical spine for myelopathy
    - Functional history of foot.
    - Other Joints involved to plan for surgery. forefoot first → Hip → Knee → hindfoot

### → Ankle Arthritis!

- Standing - hindfoot varus/ valgus, scars in previous ORIF
- Walk - loss of 2nd rocker, stiff ankle,
    - Walks with **abducted** foot to circumvent stiff ankle
- Sit - look at shoes, orthoses
    - Look at foot - calluses
    - Joint ROM - TAR requires mobile joints due to future Adjacent OA
    - Stability - TAR requires intact ligaments
    - Check Neurovascular
- Complete with history to evaluate function

### Charcot Foot

- Look
    - describe the deformity / clawing / skin changes
    - Check **spine** behind for any scars for myelodysplasia surgery
- Walk
    - Observe for walking aids - stable
- Return
    - **Romberg** test - for tabes dorsalis in neurosyphillis
- Sit
    - look at shoe for accomodation adjustments / CROW
    - Ulcer and scars, check **webspace**
    - **describe ulcer** (chronic, basic, edges, healed up malignant change eg. Marjolin ulcer, discharge), palpate if got pus
    - standard ankle movement
    - **sensation** examination (distal to proximal)
    - **pulses** - should be good
- **offer**
    - elevation of foot (reduction of erythema),
    - monofilament,
    - full neurological exam

### When ankle looks normal → SPR/ Ankle laxity

[Ankle sprain, Common peroneal nerve, Sural nerve, Peroneal tendon subluxation]

- Look
    - Stand and see - mention no pes planus, pes cavus
- Walk
    - Normal again
- Return
    - Do screening tests - tip toe, toes up
        - Observe lateral subluxation of tendons
- Sit “where is your pain?”
    - Palpate ottawa ankle rules regions
    - Anterior drawer, talar tilt
    - Screen nerve sensation - “CPN and Sural nerve neuropraxia associated with ankle injuries”
    - Palpate anterior joint line with plantarflexion for tenderness - osteochondral defect
    - Check pulses
