### MRI

- How does MRI work?
    - MRI - imaging modality that uses a magnet and radiofrequency pulses.
    - 1. Magnetic field by strong magnet - always ON
        - Protons align = **parallelism**
    - 2. RF pulses
        - Protons lose parallelism and
        - Protons gain synchronized **precession** (Precession is the axis of spin of the protons)
        
        ![Untitled](6%20Imaging%20f7273ef0f8aa459ba9a9872a90622362/Untitled.png)
        
    - 3rd - turn off radiofrequency and some timings are measured
        - T1 = time to go back to parallelism
        - T2 = time to loose precession
        - TR = Repitition time is the amount of time between successive pulse sequences
        - TE = Time to echo is the time between delievery of RF puse to the receipt of echo signals
    - 4th - post processing with various sequences
        - Spin echo pulse to create T1 and T2 weighted images
            - T1-weighted - for demonstrating anatomy
            - T2 weighted - for pathology
        - Short Tau Inversion Recovery Sequence (STIR) = fat suppression sequence
        - MARS (metal artefact reduction sequence)
        - Proton Density Sequence - useful for structures of intermediate signals e.g. meniscus, cartilage
        - Gradient Echo sequence - useful for fibrocartilaginous structures - TFCC, meniscus
- Contraindications to MRI?
    - Absolute - **Cochlear** implants (main one)
    - Relative - certain pace makers, metal implants
    - Patient factors - claustrophobic (open MRI, sedation)
- What is the magic angle effect?
    
    ![Untitled](6%20Imaging%20f7273ef0f8aa459ba9a9872a90622362/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - When tendon or tissue is oriented at **55 ° to the magnetic field, it produces bright T1 images** - false appearance of pathologic process
- What is Gadolinium? Why is it used?
    - It has **paramagnetic** properties and has 7 unpaired electrons
    - Cleared rapidly through kidney
- ‼️ Unique Complication of Gadolinium?
    - Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis - **rare, potentially fatal condition caused by iatrogenic gadolinium administration** in patients with acute kidney injury or stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD)
    - Also known as **nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD)**, is a **disease of fibrosis of the skin and internal organs** reminiscent but distinct from scleroderma or scleromyxedema
    - NSF is a specific complication of gadolinium exposure

### XRAY/ CT SCAN

- What is XR?
    - A form of high energy radiation belonging to the **upper end** of the **electromagnetic** spectrum
- How does XR work?
    
    ![Untitled](6%20Imaging%20f7273ef0f8aa459ba9a9872a90622362/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - XR are rays in the electromagnetic spectrum
    - 1 - Production of **electrons** at cathode by **heating of tungsten** to 2200 deg [Keyword: **Thermionic Emission**]
    - 2 - Electrons hit TUNGSTEN anode at 3 potential places – nucelus, outer electrons and inner electrons. Only when hit nucleus and inner electrons, "**braking Radiation XR**" produced (outer electrons produce heat)
    - 3 - XR differentially absorbed by body depending on attenuation
    - 4 - Remaining XR go to detector to become digital signal OR film (which is silver iodobromide - the more XR that lands on the silveriodobromide, it turns black))
- ⚠️ How does the image intensifier work?
    - XR tube - XR produced ➔ goes through body ➔ receiving drum
    - At the receiving drum, XR converted to **light photons** at the **input phosphor**
    - **Light photons** then converted into electrons at **photocathode**
    - Electron beam goes through **vacuum tube** what has **focusing electrodes** then strikes the **output phosphor** and converted back into visible **light**
    - **Light photons** then converted into electrons and then digitized into an image
        
        ![Untitled](6%20Imaging%20f7273ef0f8aa459ba9a9872a90622362/Untitled%203.png)
        
- Should XR emitter be closer or further away from patient?
    
    ![Untitled](6%20Imaging%20f7273ef0f8aa459ba9a9872a90622362/Untitled%204.png)
    
    - Emitter should be as far as possible - to reduce the dose to the patient's skin
    - Placing the detector as close to patient as possible maximises the intensity of radiation intercepted by the detector
- ‼️ How does the intensification work?
    - T**otal gain is** Via **minification gain** and **flux gain**
        - Because input phosphor has larger area than output phosphor, there is a **minification gain** (image is made smaller)
        - In addition, each photon at input phosphor generates 1000 photons in due to acceleration through the tube resulting in **flux gain (1:1000)**
        
        ![Untitled](6%20Imaging%20f7273ef0f8aa459ba9a9872a90622362/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - **minification gain** and **flux gain** leads to increase in brightness of the image by several thousand times (intensified)
    - Thus, Image intensifier requires less radiation ("intensified")
- Should the patient be placed nearer or further to the emitter?
    - Patient should be placed nearer to the **detector** and further from **emitter**to reduce exposure by the patient, reduces the **per-area dosage** to the body.

- What are the 3 fates of XR?
    - Transmitted through tissues
    - Absorbed by tissues (attenuation)
    - Scattered
- What is attenuation?
    - Attenuation is the extent the tissue absorbs and prevents transmission of XR
    - Tissues assigned an "attenuation coefficient" - Hounsfield units, which is relative to water
    - **Water given a value of 0**; tissues denser than water will have positive values, tissues less dense than water will have negative values.
    - Water 0, Air -1000, Bone +1000
    - Tissues less dense will be darker, tissues of higher density are brighter
- How to reduce XR exposure in OT?
    - "3 cardinal rules - Time, Distance, Shielding"
        - **Time** - reduce II time
        - **Distance** - More than **90cm** is safe
        - **Shielding** - lead gowns (store properly with no crumping, goggles)
    - Other - XR tube position should be below op table, keep II close to patient do not over magnify, use collimation, inform when shooting
    - Monitor with a Geiger Muller Counter / Dosimeter- if exceed, you go for radiation holiday.
- How does a Dosimeter work?
    - Plastic case with one quarter covered by lead, and another quarter with thinned out plastic
    - Test strip that goes into the quarter that is covered by lead is the control - it should be exposed to no radiation
    - Test strip that is at the thinned out plastic is the test - it should be exposed to maximal radiation.

- How does CT scan work?
    
    ![Untitled](6%20Imaging%20f7273ef0f8aa459ba9a9872a90622362/Untitled%209.png)
    
    - 1 **Collimated** XR source that projects a **fan-shaped beam** along with a collimated detector opposite
    - 2 Goes through tissue - **Tissue Attenuation** based on Hounsfield Unit which describes ability for tissue to attenuate XR
    - 3 **Multiple slices of images** are visualised to **compose of numerous 3D rectangular boxes of tissues known as voxels**
- What is collimation?
    - Reduction in the size of window through which XR are emitted ➔ leads to sharper radiographs and reduction in radiation dose
- What is DEXA scan?
    - Dual Energy XR Absorptiometry
    - Machine that produce two different XR beams of different energies that are absorbed in different proportions by bone and soft tissue
- Where does it measure?
    - Measures L2 to L4 vertebrae body and find the mean.

- What causes false positive and false negatives of T score?
    - **False Negative (bone density better than it is)** - Conditions that cause sclerosis or increased localised bone deposition
        - Degenerative changes a spine or hip, healed fractures, avascular necrosis, benign or metastatic bone forming lesions
        - Metal implants increase “bone density”
            - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/)
    - **False positive (bone density lower than it is)** - Conditions that cause removal of local bone
        - laminectomy defects and lytic lesions spina bifida
            - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689806/)
    - This is the reason why they provide the images - to look for possibility of false positives or negatives
- Does DEXA measure true bone density or apparent?
    - DEXA measures apparent density because it is a 2D measurement, quanitifed in g/cm2
    - Quantitative CT gives a 3D volumetric representation of bone density
- When will you repeat DEXA scan after starting bisphosphonates treatment?
    - There is high within and between patient variability, difficult to determine effects in short time span
    - Reccomended is to check again 3 years of starting treatment.

### ULTRASOUND

- What is ultrasound?
    - It is a high frequency **sound wave**.
    - Waves are either reflected or refracted at tissue interfaces.
    - Fluid filled - low echogenic. Fat filled - high echogenic
- What are the 3 fates of ultrasound waves
    - **Reflected** - high acoustic mismatch results in high reflection
    - **Absorbed** - sound wave ➔ friction between oscillating particles ➔ hear
    - **Refracted** - bending of the beam when it crosses at an oblique angle to ther interface
- ‼️ How does Ultrasound work?
    - It has 3 components - the transducer, the monitor and the computer unit
    - Transducer containing **piezoelectric** **CERAMIC** crystals. Voltage applied ➔ produce sound wave
    - Sound waves go to tissues and are either reflected transmitted or refracted
    - The amount of waves reflected at the interface is dependant on the difference in **acoustic impedence.** The larger the difference in acoustic impedence, the more energy will be reflected
    - Sound waves that returns back (echo) to the transducer is then used to generate an image
    - Computer unit – converts to data
- What is **acoustic impedence**?
    - Acoustic impedence is determined by its density. Air < soft tissue < bone
    - The larger the **difference** in acoustic impedence, the more energy is reflected, the brighter the image
    - At the interface between soft tissue and air or bone, nearly all is reflected due to large difference, thus no information can be gained
    - This explains why coupling gel is required between probe and skin to eliminate air.
- What is US used for?
    - Therapeutic - guide procedures biopsy or injections
    - Diagnostic - assess tendons, mass
    - Screening - DDH
- Advantages and Disadvantages of US?
    - (+) no radiation, small, inexpensive, portable, dynamic screening
    - (-) Operator dependant, limited views,unable to penetrate deeper structures
- How does Doppler work?
    - Doppler effect = phenomenon of a change in frequency of sound waves as a result of motion e.g. changing pitch of siren as it drives past
    - For blood flow, echo has different frequency to transduced pulse ➔ doppler signal.

### NUCLEAR IMAGING

- What is nuclear imaging?
    - Imaging modality that makes use of a **radioisotope** **or Positron emitting isotopes** coupled with a **carrier substance** that allows binding to target tissue
    - **Gamma rays** are then produced by the radioisotope **as it decays**
    - Positrons are produced by positron emitting isotopes
- ‼️ What are the common radioisotopes used?
    - Technetium 99m
    - Indium 111
    - Gallium-67
- What is half life of Technicium 99-m?
    - 6hours
    - 70% excreted in 24 hours.
- ‼️ How does Bone scan (bone scintigraphy) work?
    - Radioisotope Technetium 99m is first coupled with **Methylene Diphosphate** compounds (99TcMDP), making them have affinity for **osteoblasts**
    - Tracer then injected into body
    - Gamma camera record photoemissions – 3 phases
        - 1 - **Flow** (immediate showing **arterial** flow),
        - 2 - Blood **pool** (5min post injection - show **vascularity**),
        - 3 - **Static aka delayed phase** (3 hour post injection – showing bone **activity**)
- Causes of false positive bone scan?
    - Degenerative spine with compression fractures
    - Bone infarcts secondary to steroid, sickle cell disease
    
    [Metastatic mimics on bone scan: "All that glitters is not metastatic"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918480/)
    
- What do you tell patients before the bone scan?
    - **Hydration** - need to hydrate and pee frequently as raadioisotopes excreted from kidney. wash hands well after toileting
    - **Breast feeding** express milk before procedure. No breasft feeding at least 4 hours or preferably 24 hours after procedure
    - **Avoid children** - after scan
- What are classically cold lesions? Why are they cold?
    - Cold = **osteoclastic activity >> osteoblastic** – RCC, MM,
    - **Aggressive** cancer with **alot of osteoclastic activitity** also can be cold e.g. breast cancer

    - 
- ⚠️ How do you differentiate inflammation VS  osteomyelitis  VS Stress fracture vs MTSS on bone scan?
    - Inflammation will have increased flow and pool phase but **negative in the static/ delayed phase**
    - OM will show increased activity in all 3 phases
    - Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome [not stress fracture yet] : On the 3-phase isotope bone scan there will be typically normal appearances on the arterial and blood pool phases but longitudinal uptake on the delayed images.
    - Stress fracture “On bone scan, stress fractures are typically seen as 'three phase positive’”
- What is the "flare phenomenon" in bone scan?
    - Paradoxical increase in uptake and size of bone scan following chemo for metastatic lesion. May be due to bone repair following successful chemotherapy
- ‼️ How does PET scan work?
    - **Positron** Emitting Tomography
    - **Cyclotron produce Positron emitting isotopes**
    - Isotopes then tagged to glucose = e.g. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
    - Injected into body. Principle is that high grade malignancies will have higher rates of glycolysis so greater uptake of FDG than low grade/ benign lesions
    - Camera detect positron emission decay
    - Computer collect data – done in conjunction with PET CT or MRI
- How does white blood cell tagged scans work?
    - **Indium-111** – **autologous** leukocytes are obtained and labelled with indium111 then reinjected
