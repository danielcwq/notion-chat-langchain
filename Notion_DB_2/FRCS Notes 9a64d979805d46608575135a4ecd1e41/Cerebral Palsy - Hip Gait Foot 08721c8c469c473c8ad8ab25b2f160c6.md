- What is cerebral palsy?
    - 3 things - Static, non progressive, and permanent injury to the brain
- What are the causes?
    - **Prenatal** (30%) - infection TORCH, maternal ETOH, congenital malformation
    - **Perinatal** (60%) - prematurity!
    - **Post natal** (10%) - prolonged delievery, NAI, head trauma, menigitis
- What are the types of CP?
    - 1. By **Tone** - spastic (85%), athetoid (7%), ataxic (5%), mixed
    - 2. By **Involvement** - diplegic (50%), Hemiplegic (30%), Tetraplegic/ quadriplegic (20%)
    - 3. By **Function** - GMFCS
- How can you classify CP?
    - By function - GMFCS (Gross Motor Function Classification System)
    - 1 = independant even on stairs
    - 2 = stairs with rails
    - 3 = normal Wheelchair, can walk with aid
    - 4 = Motorised wheelchair = head control present
    - 5 = fully dependant = no head control

- What are the predictors of walking? {poor predictors?]
    - Able to sit independent by 2 years [if unable to ➔ poor]
    - Negative predictors = perisistent primitive reflexes e.g. moros at 1 year
- How do you know if this is spasticity or contracture? How do you interprete?
    - Look at the R1 and R2 of each joint
        - R1 = fast passive motion
        - R2 = slow passive movement to prevent stretch reflexes
    - **R2 - R1 = Spasticity angle**
        - Large spasticity angles indicate a large dynamic
        component (spasticity), whereas small differences
        indicate predominantly muscle contracture
        - If R1 = R2, means fixed flexion deformity with no spasticity

- What are the general principles of CP management?
    - MDT - epilepsy, feeding, vision, behavioural
    - Goal is to manage spasticity and prevent deformity while addressing contractures and skeletal deformities
    - In general focus are
        - PT for 0-3 yo
        - **SEML (Single event, multi level) at 6 yo**
        - 7-18 yo education
        - 18+ work
- In general how do you manage contractures?
    - First identify if it is **spasticity vs muscle contracture**
    - **Spasticitiy** -
        - PT, Splints to prevent going into static
        - **Botox** (binds irreversibly to Ach presynaptic vesicles to prevent release),
        - B**aclofen** (GABA agonist),
        - Selective **rhizotomy**
    - **Contractures** - Single Event Multi Level as opposed to birthday surgeries
        - Hip - Psoas, Adductor brevis
        - Knee - Hamstring (target 20 ° popliteal angle)
        - Ankle - Equinus release (controlled release to prevent crouch gait)
- What treatment is contraindicated in athetotic CP?
    - Selective rhizotomy

### CP HIP

![Note the many tubes - neuromuscular Hip](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%201.png)

Note the many tubes - neuromuscular Hip

- Where is the deficiency? As compared to DDH?
    - **PosterioSuperior** due to pressure of the dislocated hip on the acetabulum
    - Dysplasia is secondary.
- Why does the hip dislocate posteriorly? Why only one side is dislocated?
    - **1. Muscles** -
        - Adductors spasticity ➔ adducted
        - Iliopsoas spasticity ➔ flexes, IR and superiorly
    - **2. Bony** reasons
        - Valgus and higher anteversion of femoral neck
    - **3. Any form of asymmetry** such as lumbar scoliosis, postural asymmetry e.g. sleeping on one side.
        
        ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%202.png)
        
- What is the **screening** process for CP hip?
    - NICE guidelines - first XR at 3 yo, annually after.
- Which kinds of CP get Hip dislocation?
    - **Quadriplegic CP**
    - DIplegia or Hemiplegic do not get because they are still mobile
- ‼️How can you classify CP Hip?
    - By Hip coverage based on **Reimer's Migration Index**
    - Measurement of % of femoral Physis lying lateral to Perkins line over the (perpendicular) length of physis
        
        ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%203.png)
        
- How can you differentiate CP Hip/ DDH/ Perthes
    - CP Hip vs DDH - in DDH, the head is small and not well formed due to lack od remodelling in the acetbulum. in CP, the head is well formed because the dislocation occurs late
    - Bilateral DDH due to both not well formed head
- Investigations other than XR?
    - CT scan with 3D reconstruction
- ‼️ What is the management of CP Hip?
    - Dependant on **age** and **RMI** can be a variety of soft tissue and bony procedures
        - **Soft tissue** - Adductor and iliopsoas release
        - **Bony** - Acetabular re-shaping osteotomy (dega) and femoral varus derotation osteotomy
        
        ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - “Hip at risk” = RMI < 33% = soft tissue, continue screening
    - < 4 yo, RMI > 0.4 ➔ Soft tissue procedure (Adductor longs and brevis tenotomy)
    - 4-8 yo
        - < 0.6 - soft tissue = adductor release, iliopsoas release
        - > 0.6 - bony procedure
    - > 8 yo, RMI > 0.4 - **Bony procedures**

- What are the Salvage procedures?
    - Acetabulum = Chiari or Shelf
    - Femur = **Valgus** osteotomy; place LT in hip

## CP GAIT

- What is the natural progression of **Diplegic** CP gait? Management of each?
    - **Sutherlands** Classifx
    
    ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - 1 - **True equinus**
        - Tight Gastrocsoleus complex
        - Mx = Hinge AFO (allows dorsiflexion while blocking plantar flexion)
    - 2 - **Jump gait**
        - Due to tightening of hamstrings, knee is flexed and hip is flexed to push CG infront with progressively worse equinus
        - Mx = Hinge AFO
    - 3 - **Apparent Equinus** - Solid AFO
        - Due to persistent loading, ankle begins to go into dorsiflexion due to lengthening of achilles tendon.
        - But ankle ROM is still normal
        - Mx = **Solid** AFO
    - 4 - **Crouch gait** (foot flat on ground/ Equinoplanovalgus) ➔ GRAFO
        - Due to Excessive dorsiflexion due to **overlenghtened achilles**
        - One can iatrogenically cause this if you release the achilles tendon while ignoring the hamstring tightness
        - Mx = GRAFO
- How Does the GRAFO work?
    - DRAFO = Ground Reaction Ankle Foot Orthoses
    - **"GRAFO works by keeping the knee extended with the anterior tibial shell and preventing ankle dorsiflexion; keeping the GRF in front of the knee in the presence of weak quads and gastroc. "**
        
        ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - It works by controlling the distal joints to affect more proximal joints, a concept known as **coupling**
    - Used in Crouch Gait in CP
    - In the second rocker of the gait, quads are usually strong enough to prevent excessive flexion of the knee.
        
        ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - In A - However, in quads or gastroc weakness, there is excessive dorsiflexion and knee flexion ➔ Knee thus buckles and patient is unable to walk
    - In C - Anterior tibial shell prevents excessive ankle dorsiflexion, thus GRF is kept in front of the knee, helping with knee extension for weak quads
- What are the types of gastroc lengthening?
    - 3 zones described
    - **Zone 1** - origin of gastroc to termination of muscle belly.
        - In this zone, soleus is separable. So isolated gastroc lengthening is possible
        - E.g. Strayer
    - **Zone 2** - termination of gastroc muscle belly to **termination of soleus belly**
        - E.g. Vulpius V shape recession
    - **Zone 3 -** achilles tendon
        - not selective; both muscles lengthened by same amount
        - HIGHEST potential for overlengthening
        - e.g. Double or Triple hemisection
        
    
    ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%209.png)
    
- Which type of gastroc lengthening will you use?
    - Based on the **Delphi Consensus study published in 2020.**
    - For **Diplegia**:
        - Zone 1 surgery is reccomended
        - Zone 3 lengthening is contraindicated due to high risk of over-lengthening resulting in iatrogenic crouch gait or calcaneus position
        - Preference of under correction over full or over correction
    - For **hemiplegia**
        - Zone 2 or 3 is suitable
        - As usually, the equinus is more severe in hemiplega

- What is the natural progression of **hemiplegic CP** gait? Management of each?
    - Winter's classifiation
        
        ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Type 1 = "**Drop** foot" = equinus in swing phase only
    - Type 2a = "**True** Equinus" = Equinus in whole gait cycle
    - Type 2B = "True Equinus + Recurvatum knee"
    - Type 3 = "**Jump** Knee" = Equinus + tight hamstrings
    - Type 4 = Equinus + tight hamstring + tight flexors and adductors resulting in **adduction and Internal rotation** deformity

## CP Scoliosis

![Screenshot 2022-07-01 at 8.22.18 AM.png](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Screenshot_2022-07-01_at_8.22.18_AM.png)

- What are the risk factors for CP scoliosis?
    - Linked to global disability. Assessed based on
        - GMFCS (Gross Motor Function Classification System) - the higher the scoring, the higher the incidence
        - Walking ability
    - Height and weight not risk factors
    - Progression is variable, 3-4 deg/year
- Mx of CP scoliosis
    - Bracing is poorly tolerated, ineffective
    - Optimize seating position with 3 point system of lateral support pads and “tilt in space” chairs
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71/Untitled%201.png)
        
- Surgical management of CP Scoliosis?
    - Indications - Curves 50-90deg
    - **Ponte** osteotomies to correct kyphotic deformity
    - KIV anterior procedure – if rigid kyphosis
- Outcomes of surgery?
    - Prospective studies whilst parents are satisfied, surgery provided no improvement in function, school attendance or co-morbidities
    - Some systematic review suggest improvement in QOL
- Will you correct the scoliosis first or fix the hip first?
    - Principle if correct proximal first
    - Hip dislocation is contributed by pelvic obliquity leading to uncoverage
    - Correcting the pelvic obliquity will confer coverage, may not need further hip procedures

## CP Foot

- What are the types of Foot deformities in CP?
    - Equinus
    - Hallux Valgus
    - Equinoplanovalgus
    - Equinocavovarus
- How to you examine a CP child's foot?
    - Look
    - Gait
- What is the most common foot deformity in **Diplegic** CP?
    - **Equinoplanovalgus**; typically bilateral in crouch gait
    - Equinus, Flat foot with pronation
        
        ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- Pathoanatomy of equinoplanovalgus?
    - Combination of spastic peroneal muscles, weak posterior tibialis
    - Leads to bearing weight on medial border and eventual **midfoot break**
    - continued pronation leads to **hallux valgus** deformity
- Surgical management for Diplegic CP foot?
    - Medializing, varus producting Calcaneal osteotomy
- What is the most common foot deformity in **hemiplegic** CP?
    - Equinocavovarus
- Pathoanatomy of equinocavovarus?
    - Invertors (Tib post and Tib Ant) overpower evertors
- Surgical management of equinocavovarus?
    - Dynamic, correctible deformities
        - Split Posterior Tibial Tendon Transfer (SPOTT) - Tendon woven and sutured to peroneus Brevis tendon
            
            ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%2012.png)
            
        - Split Anterior Tibialis Tendon Transfer (SPLATT) from 1st MT to cuboid to correct for equinus and cavovarus
            
            ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%2013.png)
            
    - Static deformities
        - Calcaneal osteotomy/ Arthrodesis
- What is the confusion test?
    - Ask seated patient to do **active hip flexion**
    - Usually results in ankle dorsiflexion due to mass action pattern of leg
    - However, if foot supinates, then the tibialis anterior is likely s contributor to varus deformity.

## CP UL

- What is the classical deformities of CP Upper limb?
    - Shoulder IR, elbow flexed, forearm pronated, Wrist flexed and ulnar deviated, fingers flexed, thumb adducted (thumb in palm)
    
    ![Untitled](Cerebral%20Palsy%20-%20Hip%20Gait%20Foot%2008721c8c469c473c8ad8ab25b2f160c6/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    - Equivalent to a clawed hand with intrinsic minus contractures
