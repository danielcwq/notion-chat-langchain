- What are the 2 types of traction?
    - **Fixed** traction = traction is applied against a counter force applied on a part of the patient's body (old thomas splint)
    - **Sliding/ Balanced** traction = Patient's weight is balanced against the load e.g. Gallowâ€™s traction, Halter Traction, Hamilton Russell traction
- Which traction for what?
    - **Proximal Femur/ acetabulum** = Hamilton Russell
    - **Shaft** = Thomas Splint w/o pearson
    - **Distal Femur** = Thomas splint with peason attachment
- Draw Hamilton Russell Traction and Explain?
    - Traction = Hamilton Russells Traction (suitable for Proximal femur, Acetabulum fractures)
    - A form of a balanced traction
    - "Force doubling by block and tackle effect (5 pulleys)"
    - with the Body as counter traction
    - Parallelogram resultant force is in line with femur

- Draw Thomas Splint
    - Femur ring that buttress against ischial tuberosity, applying distraction force over fracture site (a kind of fixed traction) - like fernotraction

    - Line of pull is inline with femur shaft
    - New modification - thomas traction
        - Pearson attachment bends knee to relax gastroc to reduce flexion force

- What is the pearson knee attachment for?
    - To relax gastrocnemius to prevent displacement of distal femur fracture
- Gallow's Traction? Features?
    - Example of balanced traction - for femoral shaft fracture < 1 year
    - Weight limit is **10lbs**
    - Buttocks just off the bed, take off traction every 48 hours to check ski

- Dunlop's Traction?
    - For paeds supracondylar fracture

- Skeletral traction pin placements?
    - FEMUR: Insert from medial to lateral (to avoid injury to the NVB medially); **6mm pin;** 20 lbs; II go above the blaumensaat line which corresponds to the roof of the intercondylar fossa of the femur

    - TIBIA: insert from lateral to avoid CPN

- Steinmen pin vs Denham pin?
    - Steinmen pin is smooth
    - **Dunham** pin has **threads** in middle - for calcaneum

- How do you do **Halter** traction?

    - A balanced traction for neck
    - Chin stype stirrup attached to cord
    - Head end is raised to allow body weight to provide counter traction
    - Can be done at home or hospital
    - Small amounts (5 pounds)
    - Do with muscle relaxants and analgesics
