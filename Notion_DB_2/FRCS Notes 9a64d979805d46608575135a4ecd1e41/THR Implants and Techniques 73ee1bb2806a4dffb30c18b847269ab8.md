## STEMS

- Cemented vs Uncemented Pros and Cons?
    - Cement (+) - can adjust version, lower incidence of intraop fracture, reduced end of stem pain, cemented in antibiotics
    - Cement (-) - potentially longer op time, Cement implantation syndrome
    - Cementless (+) - biologic growth
    - Cementless (-) - higher risk of periop #, thigh pain, increase stress shielding
- **What are the Cemented femoral stem options?**

    - **Tapered Slip (CPT) [Force-closed]/ Exeter Stem**
        - **Collarless** ➔ allow subsidence
        - **Polished** ➔ no bonding
        - **Tapered** (double taper AP and ML) ➔ allows subsidence ➔converts shear forces to compression stresses ➔ countered by the hoop stresses generated by the cement mantle and femoral canal ➔ ↑ stability
        - Load transfer is by hoop stresses
    - **Composite Beam [Shape-closed]/ Charnley Stem**
        - Collar ➔ prevent subsidence, prevents stress shielding
        - Rough ➔ cement bone bonding
        - Cylindrical
        - Load is transferred to bone **by shear stress** at stem cement interface
    - **Isoelastic stems (historical)**
        - 2 different materials. - stainless steel core with polyacetal resin outside.
        - An attempt to overcome stress shielding.
- How does the composite beam work?
    - It converts longitudinal stress into **shear stress**, similar to how a well bonded cementless implant would work.
    - Rama: “These are high shear stresses, low compressive stresses and medium tensile stresses.”
- What is the Charnley evolution - identify a Charnley stem?
    - For exams, Charnley = composite beam
    - 4 generations - Polished - Matt - Matt - Polished
    - 1st gen - **polished**, **flat** back
    - 2nd gen - **round** back with **matt** (vanquished)
    - 3rd gen - Matt with cobra flange
    - 4th gen - **polished** triple taper C stem

- What is the triple slip in C-stem?
    - **Coronal, Sagittal and Axial tapers**
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%204.png)
        
- Composite Beam vs Taper Slip?
    - I will choose taper slip because this is what i am trained in
    - Aware that both stem philosophies have shown **excellent results in several European registries**, but their modes of failure might differ
        - Composite beam - aseptic loosening
        - Taper Slip - slightly higher risk of periprosthetic fracture
    - But overall, NJR showed a significant survival advantage of the most popular taper-slip design over all other groups of patients. (97.9% vs 97.5%) - practically the same..

- ‼️ Role of centralizer in taper slip stem?
    - Improves **quality and homogeniety** of distal cement mantle
    - Allows subsidence into air filled centralizer
    - Prevents **“end bearing”** of distal metal tip on cement to prevent cement cracking
- What is the benefit of subsidence in taper slip?
    - Reduces effective joint space
    - Cement is loaded in compression rather than shear  compared to composite beam
- Difference between Moore and Thompson implant?
    - Both are unipolar implants
    - Austin MOOre implant - has holes (OOOO); **uncemented**
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - Thompson implant - **cemented** with no holes
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%208.png)
        
- What are isoelastic stems?
    - aka Robert Mathys (RM) isoelastic stems
    - To overcome mismatch between stiff stem and more elastic bone; concept of isoelasticity was introduced
    - Polyesterate resin with stainless steel core; uncemented implant
    - Require screws at the proximal side to anchor the implant
    - **Very poor outcomes.** 69% at 10 years! 48% survival rates at 15 years!

## CEMENTLESS Stems

- **What are the Uncemented Femoral Stem options?**
    - 2 types of bone growth
        - **In-Growth = Porous**
            - Stronger
            - Criteria (rule of 50) – pore **size** 50 micrometer, porosity (pore **density** ) 50%, **micromotion** < 50 micrometer,  **gap** < 50 micrometer
        - **On growth** = micro divots by **grit blasting**
    - 2 types of insertion
        - Press fit = under ream 1 size
        - Line-to line aka Scratch fit aka interference fit= ream to same size
- How is HA coating used in THR?
    - Osteoinductive; not an adhesive
    - Hydorxyapatite is for **bony ongrowth only**. Not for bony ingrowth.
        - HA is gradually replaced by bone
    - Problem → coating delamination leading to third body wear and osteolysis
- How can you classify uncemented stems?
    - By fit - press fit or line to line
    - By surface growth - in or on growth
    - By shape
- How can you classify uncemented stems by shape?
    - Describe by area of fit (**Khanuja Classifx**) but grow into 3 types:
    - **Metaphyseal** fit (proximally coated)
        - Type 1 = single wedge - only ML taper
        - Type 2 = double wedge - AP + ML taper
    - **MetaDiaphyseal** Fit (fully coated)
        - Type 3 = longer stem
        - Type 6 = Anatomic stem
    - **Diaphyseal** fit (modular and tapered for revisions)
        - Type 4 = Long stem Cylindrical fully coated
        - Type 5 = Modular
    
    ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2010.png)
    
- ‼️ What is Stress shielding?
    - Mechanical load **bypass** proximal femur because ingrowth present throughout diaphysis resulting in osteopenia and bone loss
    - This is due to **Hoek's law** which states that when 2 springs of different stiffness are loaded next to each other, more force will be loaded through the stiffer spring and bypasses the proximal bone that is less stiff.
    - Occurs in extensively coated stems.
    - DOES NOT occur in taper slip stems.
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- How to prevent stress shielding? What law?
    - 1. **Stem stiffness** most important - need to match modulus.
        - **Hoek's law** when 2 springs of different stiffness are loaded next to each other, more force will be loaded through the stiffer spring.
        - Thus, a stem with higher modulus will see more loading
    - 2. **Extent of porous coating.** Proximal coated stems will reduce stress stress sheilding
    - 3. **Collar** will transmit forces to medial proximal calcar
- Circumfrential vs patchy coating?
    - Patchy coating allows debris to track down the smooth sides - leads to increased effective joint space.
    - Circumfrential coating can seal off the canal
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 9.39.44 AM.png](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_9.39.44_AM.png)
        

- How do we know if the **cementless** stem if stable or not? (planning for extraction)
    - Assess as per **Glassman and Engh 1992**
    - Divides fixation modes into 3; implications = will determine ease of extraction
        - If Stable and fibrous = cannot be removed by simple disimpaction ➔ need ETO and burr
    - **Stable fixation** = no subsidence, enodosteal hypertrophy (**spot weld**), proximal atrophy [stress sheilding means good fixation!] , no reactive lines
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled.png)
        
    - **Stable fibrous encapsulation** = no subsidence or stabilize in 1 year, parallel reactive lines, minimal proximal atrophy
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - **Unstable fixation** = progressive subsidence, toggle, hypertrophy at collar at stem tip, **pedestal** formation (pedestaling) , canal enlargement ➔ usually unstable
- Does presence of pedestal always mean unstable?
    - If no new radiolucencies or reactive lines, it can be associated with a stable stem.
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2012.png)
        

![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 12.15.35 PM.png](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_12.15.35_PM.png)

- Tell me about this stem?
    - Collared
    - **Bowed** to fit into diaphysis
    - Hole at the top for easier removal
    - Fits by “diaphyseal scratch fit”, requires 2 cortical diameters

![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 12.42.43 PM.png](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_12.42.43_PM.png)

- Why the difference?
    - Left side - Bony in growth,
    - Right side - bony on growth with HA coating. Layer of Hydroxyapatite coating that has been stripped off during explant. So bone is not on it.

## TRUNNION

- ‼️ What is a Morse taper?
    - It is a method of mounting 2 rotating machine parts together
    - **Cone-in-cone** structure, self locking through an interference fit, providing both axial and rotational stability
    - Mismatch between the Trunnion is the male part (the **core**), Bore is the female part (the hole)
    - Aims to have **cold welding** between the 2 components
    - **Critical locking angle** is less than 7 °
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2013.png)
        
- Why is Stryker Exeter called V40?
    - Stryker Exeter - taper angle is 5° 40' (V40)
    - Each degree is divided in to 60 minutes, each minute into 60 seconds
- What does 12/14 taper mean?
    - It describes the male trunnion (cone)
    - 12mm is the proximal diameter, 14mm is the distal diamete
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2014.png)
        
- Why cannot mix heads and femoral head?
    - There can be "negative mismatch" in the design features resulting in more trunnionosis
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2015.png)
        
- What is trunnion wear?
    - It is a form of **FRETTING CORROSION**
    - It is a form of Mode 4 Wear (between 2 unintended surfaces)
- What increase trunnion wear?
    - Large diameter head > 36mm
    - Large offset/ Long neck (increases moment arm)
    - Varus positioning

## CUPS

- Cemented vs Uncemented Cups?
    - Cemented cups **theoretically fail at higher rates due to more shear forces.**
    - Cement is strong in compression, weak in tension and shear
    - Original Charnley design were cemented cups but due to attractive idea of biological integration, more cementless cups done today
    - **Frank Van Praet et al. Systematic review** -
        - “Both cemented and hybrid models provide excellent results in both the short and the long term.
        - However, the widespread preference for cementless fixation of the acetabulum cannot be explained by a superior survival of cementless or hybrid models. Irrespective of age, cemented fixation of the acetabulum remains the gold standard to which other techniques should be compared.”
- What are the parts of the Cemented cup?
    - PMMA **Pods**/ spacer beads to avoid **bottoming out phenomenon** (so that cement between bone and implant)
    - **Flange** at rim to aid in pressurisation
    - **Grooves** to increase stability within mantle
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2016.png)
        
    - **Wire markers** - placed in anterior hemisphere of cup
        - **Crescent** shape - good version
        - **Hemipshere** - 0 version
        - Olive shape - retroversion
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2017.png)
        
- What are the Acetabular Cup Options?
    - Hemispherical cup +/- lip
    - **Constrained** Cup [for neuromuscular conditions]
        - = Head locked in cup
        - Higher constraint = increased wear
    - **Dual Mobility** Cups aka Tripolar aka (Modular Dual Mobility MDM by stryker)
        - Femoral head that moves within a PE component, which also moves within a shell
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2018.png)
        
        - Consider in patients with prior spine fusion/ dislocating THR
        - Greater ROM and stability, smaller head less wear
        - ➖ Higher constraint = increased wear
- Types of contact between head and cup? [Radial Clearance]
    - This is only applicable for MOM THR because of the hard nature of the bearing
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2019.png)
        
    - First gen MOM THR typically had **Equatorial contact** due to limitations in manufacturing. I.e. Head is larger than cup; so articulation is at the equator (widest portion of head)
        - This resulted in friction and boundary lubrication as it prevents  between cup and head "fluid entrainment"
        - Leads to fluid “lockout” state, causing high friction and wear
        - This led to implant seizing and subsequent premature loosening
    - **Polar Contact** allowed for sufficient clearance for **fluid entrainment/ ingress** ➔ Optimizes lubrication (fluid film)
        - Can be high conformity = good [**midpolar contact]**
        - Or low conformity = leading to point loading (not good)
- How is initial stability achieved?
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 9.47.16 AM.png](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_9.47.16_AM.png)
    
    - Immediate stability is achieved by **press fit (conferring hoop stresses)**, screws, (spikes and pegs in older designs)

### Bearings

- How can you tell this is CoC from XR?
    
    ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2020.png)
    
    - Can appreciate that the head is more radioluscent than the stem = ceramic and not metal
    - Also, COC cannot see holes on acetabulum as clearly
        
        ![COP - can see the holes on acetabulum much more obviously](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Screenshot_2022-08-26_at_6.07.08_PM.png)
        
        COP - can see the holes on acetabulum much more obviously
        

## MY IMPLANT CHOICE

- ‼️ What is the Dorr's Classification?
    - It is the ratio of the canal and calcar width measured from 3cm and 10cm from the middle of Lesser trochanter
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2021.png)
        
    - Dorrs A = CC ratio < 0.5
    - Dorrs B = CC 0.5-0.75
    - Dorrs C = CC > 0.75 (width at canal almost that of calcar)
- What is **ODEP** rating?
    - Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel with 3 factors
    - Number of years, strength of evidence (registry data will be stronger) and presence of a star which denotes benchmark replacement of less than 5% at 10 years
    
    ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2022.png)
    
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the different bearing wear rates?

        - Head size aim 32mm. More than or less than 32mm ➔ increased revision rates after 3 months
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2032.png)
            
        - Head size 36mm vs 32mm?
            - The Australian Registry did not find any difference until after 10 years, but at 14 years, the revision rate was 8.5% (66,973 primary THA) with 36 mm heads and 4.6% (84,157 primary THA) with 32 mm heads. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6259905/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6259905/))
        - Approach? No difference in rate of revision for all approaches
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2033.png)
            
- What approach will you use?
    - “I will use the posterior approach for 2 reasons
        - 1. familiar and trained in it.
        - 2. It is extensile to deal with complications.
    - I will be mindful to repair the posterior joint capsule and short external rotators attachment to reduce risk of dislocation.”
        - Kwon et al. 2006 systematic review – found comparable dislocation rates with AL, direct lateral and posterior approaches with soft tissue repair
- Pros and Cons Posterior vs Lateral?
    - Posterior + : No violation of abductor mechanism, better acetabulum exposure, similar dislocation rates if repair soft tissue.
- Pros and Cons Posterior vs Anterior?
    - There is no consensus on which is the better approach and literature is conflicted
    - I am aware that AOJNRR found OVERALL no difference in revision rates for all approaches.
    - But in addition,
        - Data from Australian registry (Wayne Hoskins et al. JBJS 2020)suggest higher rate of early major revision for periprosthetic fracture/ loosening;
        - 2019 Frank Stinchfield Award paper suggest higher rates of infection in anterior approach (2.2x) BUT AOJNRR shows lower revision rates for infection for Anterior approach
- ‼️ Does approach affect dislocation rates?
    - Swedish and Norweigian registry shows no difference in dislocation rates in posterior vs lateral approaches
        - Norwegian registry
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2034.png)
            
        - Swedish Registry
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2035.png)
            
    - **AOJNRR** - overall no difference in revision rates for all approaches
    - When i do posterior approach, I will be mindful to repair the posterior soft tissue to reduce the risk of dislocation. This is based on Kwon et al. 2006 systematic review – found comparable dislocation rates with AL, direct lateral and posterior approaches with soft tissue repair

- What is the ideal THR implant positioning?
    - Ideal is to place the implant **primary arc range within patient's functional range**
    - Lewinnek proposed Safe zones in 1978
        - Cup inclincation 40 +/- 10; anteversion 15 +/- 10
        - Stem anteversion ~ 15 deg
    - However aware that studies show that even when placed in this position, dislocations still occur
    - Recent publications suggest other methods of determining positioning such as the concept of Combined anteversion proposed by Dorr et al. in 2009. **Target is 35 +/10**
    - Without navigation, this can be assessed with the Ranawat Sign intraoperatively but less accurately. Patient must be in lateral position and hip stabilized
    - This is done by placing operated leg in extension, internally rotate from neutral foot position until base of femoral head is parallel to the acetabulum component
    - This angle will be the **combined anteversion angle. Target is 35 +/-10**

- How do you place acetabular screws?
    - Draw line from ASIS to center of acetabulum // Perpendicular line to it
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%2073ee1bb2806a4dffb30c18b847269ab8/Untitled%2037.png)
        
    - Aim for posterior-superior quadrant
    - Anterior inferior – Obturator NVB
    - Anterior superior – external iliac NVB
    - Posterior inferior – Sciatic nerve (ok but use screw < 20mm)
- How do you critique the XR?

    - Gruen Zone – 14! Tip is 7 and 11
    - Cup - Delee and Charnley Zones 3
    - CEMENTED - **Barrack and Harris Grading** – lucency at **cement-bone** interface
        - A = complete filling
        - B = Radiolucent line <50%
        - C = > 50%
        - D = Complete radiolucent line 100%
    - **UNCEMENTED** - features of fixation
        - "spotwelding" - enodsteal bone that contacts porous surface of implant
        - No subsidence on serial radiographs (no migration)

### Joint Registry and Implant Choice

- What is a joint registry?
    - It is the Longitudinal collection of data on implants and results of all surgeons in one area i.e. all comers
    - The oldest is the swedish hip registry established in 1975
    - UL National registry was established in 2002, biggest registry
- What are the uses of a joint registry?
    - **Hospital** - identify trends in implant use, outcomes
    - **Individual Surgeon** - Know their revision rate and compare to others to identify outlier and to refine technique
    - **Implant** company - post market surveillance, recall implants if faulty early
    - **Research** - survival analysis
- What are the strength of using joint registry data?
    - Large numbers - overcome bias
- What are the cons of joint registry?
    - Outcome studied
        - **Outcome studied is revision** - hence, failures that do not result in revision are not captured
        - No **patient reported outcome measures** (only recently started in NJR)
        - No radiological or clinical outcomes
    - **Quality** is as good as data inserted - potential flaws with missing entry, unliked entries, case mix
    - Fails to consider the standard that can be achieved in expert hands (as this is all comer data)
    - **Costly** to maintain registry data
- What sparked the use of registry data?
    - **3M capital hip.**
    - It was marketed from 1991 to 1997 but the question of performance was only raised in 1995
    - Survey of surgeons found revision rate of 5% but was considered to be by implant company as “industry standards” before further monitoring led to withdrawal of the device

### Implant/Approach Choice

### “Implant choice based on basic science principles, my training and registry data - can be divided into type of fixation”

- What is your implant fixation choice for this patient?
    - Hybrid fixation as this is what I am trained and comfortable in
    - Cup -
        - Cemented cups are theoretically subjected to shear forces and this is what cement is weak in.
        - However, I am aware that systematic reviews do not show a difference in survival rates
        - Nevertheless, I will use cementless cups to avoid shear stresses and to allow for biological integration
    - Step
        - My choice will be the exeter taper slip stem which is a cemented stem working on the force closed design to have controlled subsidence
        - Why Exeter is because it is a **ODEP 15A*** stem with at least 15 year registry data, and a benchmark replacement rate of less than 5% in 10 years
    - My decision is supported by the Australian registry that finds no difference in revision rates for hybrid vs cementless for patients **Age < 64**
    - For **patients > 65** Cementless have a higher revision rate that hybrid fixation, especially in those > 75 yo 15 year revision rate is **7.9% vs 4.9%**
- What is your bearing surface of choice?
    - [For all age groups]
    - I will use Metal on XLPE for this patient
        - This is due to the superior wear properties compared to non XLPE on Metal
        - I am aware of the options of Cement on poly or CoC but but they come at a higher cost. CoC also has the unique failure mechanisms of squeaking, edge loading, patch wear and risk of catastrophic failure
    - My decision is supported by the Australign registry as there is no difference in revision rates at **15 years**
        - **6.2% (MoP) vs 5.0% (CoP) vs 7.1% (CoC)**
    - With regards to XLPE vs non XLPE
        - 15 year revision rates was **6% vs 11%**
- What is the head size you will use?
    - Head size choice is a **balance between wear and stability**
    - compromise between wear rates and stability. wear rates higher with larger head size. Revision rates are lowest with head size of 32mm
    - Head size – aiming for **32mm** due to lowest rates of revision compared to < 32 and > 32 similar rates – Australian registry.

## COMPLICATIONS

- Causes of post THR sciatic nerve palsy?
    - ~50% - unknown
    - Compression due to hematoma, intra op **retraction**
    - Direct trauma - screws
    - Limb lengthening if > 5cm
- Usually which division?
    - Peroneal division 80% [same as in hip dislocation]
- How will you investigate?
    - Can do MRI - to evaluate for hematoma
    - Early NCS, EMG
- Management of post THR sciatic nerve palsy?
    - Acutely - immediately **flex knee** with 1/2 pillows to reduce tension
    - Evacuate hematoma if present
    - If MRI normal ➔ serial NCS
- Outcomes of post THR Sciatic nerve palsy?
    - 1/3 full recovery, 1/3 partial recovery.
- What are your thoughts on bilateral THR?
    - No consensus on what is best
    - Meta-analysis comparing one stage vs 2 stage did not find difference in death, PE, CVS complications, infection
    - Single stage had lower risk of DT, and shorter operative time shorter stay.
    - Benefits - one anaethesia, one hospital stay, cost reduction
    - Cons - more blood transfusion, greater risk, longer op.
    - Each have risks and benefits and must be weighted in light of individual’s patients needs and concerns.

## Robotics/ Navigation

- How can you compare robotics systems?
    - **Image dependant vs imageless**
        - Need CT scan/ MRI to generate 3D model vs intraoperative calibration of landmarks
    - **Passive vs Semi-active vs Active**
        - No haptic feedback vs Surgeon can guide within confinements with haptic feedback vs totally automatic
    - **Closed vs open platforms**
        - paired with a certain implant vs can be used with other brands
