- What is Neurofibromatosis
    - G = Mutation of NF-1 gene - tumor suppressor gene (so defect in it leads to growth of neurofibromas)
    - E = Defect in neurofibromin Protein.
    - I = Autosomal dominant
- What are the types of NF?
    - NF 1 = Von Recklinghaussen Disease (most common)
    - NF 2 = a/w bilateral vestibular schwannomas
    - Segmental NF1 = features of NF1 but only involves a single body segment
- If you suspect Neurofibromatosis, how will you assess?
    - **Hx** = Family history, visual impairment, symptoms (leg pain from pseudoarthosis), back pain (scoliosis)
    - **PE - identify NIH Critiera**
    - Skin - Cafe spots, axillary freckling, plexiform fibromas
    - Eye - harmatomas, gliomas,
    - Spine - scoliosis
    - LL - bowing, hemihypertrophy
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Diagnostic Criteria based on NIH (national institute of health) Criteria **2 or more** of following **7**? [CAFESPOT]
    - **Cafe**Au-Lait Spots (> 6 over 5mm in prebuberal; > 15mm post-pubertal),
    - **Axillary** freckles,
    - **Fibroma** (plexiform),
    - **Eye** harmatomas (lisch nodules),
    - **Skeletal** sclerosis (pseudoarthrosis),
    - **Positive** family history,
    - **Optic** Glioma
- What investigations?
    - XR of relevant parts
    - MRI spine - **Dumbell tumors** - thoracic neurofibroma that have **both a intraspinal and paraspinal component**
        
        ![Untitled](Pediatric%20Syndromes%20and%20Others%2038140804d779489c8a8ca26dfcb6fa5d/Untitled%201.png)
        
- How will you evaluate this lump?
    - Suspect that this is a plexiform neurofibroma - confirm that it is not in skin layer, muscle or joint
    - Non tender
    - **Tinel** sign
    - Check **nerves** distal to it!
    - Evaluate for NIH criteria - look at spine
- What can NF present with?
    1. Scoliosis [Scoliosis - AIS, JIS, Congenital, NM, Adult](Scoliosis%20-%20AIS,%20JIS,%20Congenital,%20NM,%20Adult%2008b449e461e9478488db09125e47ae71.md) 
    2. AL bowing Pseudoarthrosis = [Tibia Bowing](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b.md)

- What is it?
    - Congenital fusion of > 2 cervical ribs. C3 is most common.
    - Due to failure of normal segmentation of C-spine
        
        ![Untitled](Pediatric%20Syndromes%20and%20Others%2038140804d779489c8a8ca26dfcb6fa5d/Untitled%203.png)

    - Classic triad - Low posterior hair line, short webbed neck, limited cervical ROM
    - Sprengel‚Äôs deformity
    - If fusion is below C3 = usually asymptomatic
    - If fusion if above C3 = will have symptoms ‚ûî presenting with **basilar invagination, AA instability**
- What else to look for?

![Untitled](Pediatric%20Syndromes%20and%20Others%2038140804d779489c8a8ca26dfcb6fa5d/Untitled%205.png)

- What is it caused by?
    - Abnormal descent of scapula during embryonic development
- How will you examine this child?
    - [Look]
        - Features of KFS - low hair line, short webbed neck
        - Noted asymmetrical shoulder scapula
        - ROM of shoulder
        - ROM of neck - stiff
        - Check spine for any spina bifida
    - [Gait]
        - Walk - look for trendelenberg - associated with PFFD. If positive, do trendelenberg test
        - Check for winging scapula by pushing on the wall
    - [Offer]
        - Examine UL for neurological signs from AA instability or Spinal cord compression
- Associations of Sprengel Shoulder?

    - Klippel Feil (1/3 have),
    - Spina bifida, short femur,
    - Tibial hemimelia
    - Poland, VACTERL
- What is the pathology?
    - Presence of Omovertebral **tether** (35%) - runs from superomedial border of scapula to spinous processes
    - **3 types** of Omovertebral connections - true joint, fibrous, synostosis, pseudarthrosis
- What investigation?
    - XR, CT 3D recon, XR spine to screen for congenital scoliosis
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è How to classify?
    - Clinical Cavendish 1972 based on severity and visibility
        
        ![Untitled](Pediatric%20Syndromes%20and%20Others%2038140804d779489c8a8ca26dfcb6fa5d/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Grade 1 = Very mild = shoulders levels can‚Äôt see when dressed
    - 2 = Mild - can see deformity **< 2cm**
    - 3 = Moderate - shoulder elevated **2-5cm**, very obvious
    - 4 = Severe - shoulder elevated **> 5cm**; superior angle of scapula lies near occiput
- What do they present with?
    - Limited shoulder abdution
    - Cosmetic
        
        ![Untitled](Pediatric%20Syndromes%20and%20Others%2038140804d779489c8a8ca26dfcb6fa5d/Untitled%207.png)
        
- What are the surgical principles of correction
    - 2 main surgical procedures described - Woodward's (most commonly used) and Green's
    - Both involve 3 main steps
        - **Excision** of omovertebral attachments
        - **Transfer** of medial scapula muscles
        - **Protection** of brachial plexus - To prevent brachial plexus injury, clavicle resection osteotomy is reccomended to decompress the BP.
    - Key difference in both are where the muscles are detached:
        - **Woodward's** - release and relocation of muscles from spinous processes and attached distally
        - **Green's** - muscles detached from medial border of scapula and then reattached after moving scapula distally
- What other treatment options?
    - **Vertical Osteotomy** of scapula
    - JBJS 2006 McMurty et al.

    ![Untitled](Pediatric%20Syndromes%20and%20Others%2038140804d779489c8a8ca26dfcb6fa5d/Untitled%208.png)
    
- How does clavicle resection prevent Brachial plexus injury?
    - If you do not resect it, when we bring the scapula down together with the clavicle, it will compress on the brachial plexus
