### TFCC Injuries

- What is the anatomy of the TFCC?
    - Palmer 1981: Complex structure that is not discretely identifiable as separate structures but are merely anatomic areas of the homogenous TFCC. Consists of:

    - Triangular fibrocartilage proper (articular disc)
    - Meniscal homologue
    - Dorsal and volar radioulnar ligament
    - Ulnacarpal collateral ligament
    - Ulnotriquetriual, Ulnounate, ulnocapitate ligaments
    - Sheath of ECU
- How does Pronation and Supination affect the DRUJ? Which ligament involved?
    - In **supination**, the **dorsal** radio-ulnar ligaments confer stability. When dorsal RUL cut, ulnar subluxes volarly.

    - In **pronation**, the **volar** radio-ulnar ligaments confer stability. When they are cut, the ulnar subluxes dorsally. Remember as **pinao key sign in pronation is due to loss of volar ligaments.**

- Blood supply of TFCC and implications?
    - **Good peripheral; dorsal better than volar**
        - Central avascular
    - Supplied by 3 arteries (*no supply from radial artery)
        - **1. Ulnar** artery ➔ palmar and dorsal branches
        - 2. Dorsal branch of Anterior interosseous artery
        - 3. Palmar branch of Anterior interosseous Artery

- Risk factors for TFCC injury?
    - Intrinsic = anatomical **positive ulnar variance** (can be primary or secondary from prior fracture)
    - Extrinsic = **trauma**
- Clinical tests for  instability?
    
    TFCC/ DRUJ 4 tests
    
    - **Fovea Sign**
        - Fovea is between FCU tendon and Ulnar Styloid
            
            ![Untitled](Ulnar%20Sided%20Injuries%20-%20TFCC,%20Ulnar%20Abutment%2024bca1c8f6b14654a92f39c7a2beb992/Untitled%204.png)
            
    - **TFCC Compression/ Stress test**
        - Same as Scaphoid Shift Test aka Kirk Watson's Test but without thumb on scaphoid
        - Axial load across wrist at ulnar side followed by **radial ulnar deviation**  on the wrist. Painful click is positive
            
            ![Untitled](Ulnar%20Sided%20Injuries%20-%20TFCC,%20Ulnar%20Abutment%2024bca1c8f6b14654a92f39c7a2beb992/Untitled%205.png)
            
    - **Piano Key** test - looking at dorsal subluxation
        - Place both hands on an exam table
        - just press the ulna head down like a piano key and see it pop up
    - Radiolulnar drawer/ ballotment test
        - Stabilize the radius
        - move ulna dorsally and volarly

- Classification of TFCC injuries?
    - **Palmer** Classification: Traumatic vs Degenerative
    - **Traumatic** - further subdivide into location (central vs peripheral)
    - **Degeneration** - further subdivided into extent of wear
        
        ![Untitled](Ulnar%20Sided%20Injuries%20-%20TFCC,%20Ulnar%20Abutment%2024bca1c8f6b14654a92f39c7a2beb992/Untitled%207.png)
        
- Management of Acute, Traumatic TFCC injuries?
    - Trial of Non op - wrist widget, Muenster Splint
    - If fail Non op ➔ Surgery
    - Surgery Decide by vascularity vs chronicity
        - open vs arthroscopic repair vs debridement
        - Acute = can consider repair
        - Location - Dorsal vs Central

- Management of Chronic, Degenerative TFCC/ Ulnar Abutment Syndrome?
    - **"Offloading procedures"**
        - < 2mm ulnar positive = **Wafer** procedure
        - > 2mm ulnar positive = ulnar **shortening** osteotomies
    - **Salvage** Procedures - if OA changes and pain

        - Darrach, Sauve-kapandji, Bower’s hemiresection
        - **Resection** of distal ulna - Darrach's
            
            ![Untitled](Ulnar%20Sided%20Injuries%20-%20TFCC,%20Ulnar%20Abutment%2024bca1c8f6b14654a92f39c7a2beb992/Untitled%209.png)
            
        - **Arthrodesis** of DRUJ with proximal pseudoarthrosis- Suave Kapanji technique
            
            ![Untitled](Ulnar%20Sided%20Injuries%20-%20TFCC,%20Ulnar%20Abutment%2024bca1c8f6b14654a92f39c7a2beb992/Untitled%2010.png)
            
- Principle of Muenster Splint?
    - It prevents forearm pronation and supination
- Principles of Wrist Arthroscopy?
    - Portals named by relation to extensor compartments
    - Finger traps to distract joint
    - Typically **3-4** (between #3 and #4) and **6R** (between #5 and #6) portals

### Ulnar Abutment Syndrome

- What is it?
    - Excessive impact between ulna and lunate
- What is the normal loading mechanics at ulnar?
    - Normal loading is 80% radius, 20% ulna
    - +2mm Ulnar variance positive ➔ 60% radius, 40% ulna
- Causes of ulnar abutment syndrome?
    - Radial shortening from #, TFCC degenerative tear
- What clinical tests?
    - Nakamura stress test aka Ulnocarpal stress test
        - The difference between this and TFCC compression test is the **pronation supination** component. While TFCC compression test is a Radial-ulnar deviation movement.
