### PAIN

- ‼️ What is pain?
    - Pain is a **normal uncomfortable respons**e to an **noxious stimuli/ tissue damage that alerts the person to danger.**
    - **OR** it can be neuropathic in nature whereby there is no real damage distally but pain due to nerve injury.
    - Chronic pain can lead to…
- What are the complications of chronic pain?
    - **Psychological** - depression
    - **Disuse** of limb - wasting, osteoporosis
    - **Immobility** - obesity, metabolic disease
- ‼️ What are the 3 theories of Pain?
    - **1. Gate Theory -**
        - **non painful input closes nerve gates** to painful input in the spinal cord
        - This example can be seen when we hit our leg, we rub around the area so that non painful input closes the painful nerve gates.
        - this is the principle of certain pain modality treatment such as electrostimulation
    - **2. Opioid System -**
        - opioid receptors in spinal cord and brain (**mu, delta and kappa**) that modulate pain
        - When activated, results in the inhibition of release of substance P, reducing pain
    - **3. Descending inhibitory system**
        - Suggests that pain is due to dysfunction in inhibitory system resulting in chronic pain
        - Thus Serotonin reuptake inhibitors can help with pain
- What are the lower limb blocks you aware off?
    - Femoral nerve block - (-) Quads weakness affecting therapy
    - Adductor canal block - (+) no quads weakness
- How does paracetamol work?
    - Mechanism not well understood, inhibits **prostaglandin** synthesis
- How does NSAIDS work?
    - Inhibits COX - cyclooxgenase enzymes with catalyzes conversions of Arachidonic acid to Prostaglandins and Thromboxane (anti-inflammatory)
        - COX-1 enzymes - in gastric mucosa, kidney
        - COX-2 - active in inflammatory
    - Thus, newer selective COX-2 inhibitors e.g. etoricoxib aims to reduce SE
- How does Tramadol work?
    - Mimic endogenous opioid peptide by causing activation of opoid receptors (Mu receptors in CNS) ➔ reduces pain
- How does Gabapentin or pregabalin work?
    - It is a Gaba Aminobutryic Acid (GABA) mimetic
    - Binds to Alpha 2 Delta site in CNS, **reducing release** of **neurotransmitter** Glutamate, Norepinephrine
- What is Pre-emptive analgesia?
    - Concept was establised by Crile in 1913
    - Defined as “anti-nociceptive treatment that **prevents the establishment** of altered central processing of afferent input, which amplifies pain after TKA”
    - Method is via multimodal analgesia given before patient experiences pain

### NERVE PAIN

- How is neuropathic pain different from nociceptive pain?
    - **Nociceptive** pain caused by **actual tissue damage** whereas neuropathic pain is produced either by damage to or pathological change in the nerves.
    - Examples - spinal stenosis, radiculopathy, phantom limb pain
- How to treat nerve pain?
    - Stepwise ladder
        - Paracetamol
        - **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA)** - Amitryptyline. Watch for cardiac toxicity
        - **Anticonvulsants** - Gabapentin, pregabalin
        - Tramadol
    - Pain team referral

### ⚠️ CRPS

- ‼️ What is CRPS?
    - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome is syndrome associated with **5 Features PSSAO**
        - 1. Disproportionate pain (allodynia)
        - 2. Swelling
        - 3. Stiffness
        - 4. **Autonomic** disturbance - discoularation, trophic changes
        - 5. Disuse osteopenia
- Pathophysiology of CRPS?
    - CRPS develops when a **persistent noxious stimuli** (eg. distal radius fracture) leads to peripheral and central **sensitization**, leading to abnormally heighten sensation including spontaneous pain
- What are the types of CRPS?
    - **Type 1** - No nerve injuries or lesions (90%)
    - **Type 2** - Presence of nerve injury - do NCS
- What are the stages of CRPS?
    - 1. **Acute** - localised, painful, warm, dry and red, normal bones
    - 2. **Subacute** (Dystrophic) - start to get cold and muscle wasting, with osteopenia on XR
    - 3. **Chronic** (Atrophic) - less pain now, but muscle atrophic, skin glossy. Severe osteoporosis
    
    ![Untitled](4%20Ortho%20Pharmacology%20bebaa569958144ab8bc05704eaf7ffaa/Untitled.png)
    
- How to diagnose CRPS?
    - **Budapest** Criteria - based on symptoms and signs in 4 categories - sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor
        - **Sensory** = allodynia
        - **Trophic** = reduced ROM, reduced hair
        - **Vasomotor** = Temperature asymmetry
        - **Edema** = swelling, sweating changes
    
    ![Untitled](4%20Ortho%20Pharmacology%20bebaa569958144ab8bc05704eaf7ffaa/Untitled%201.png)
    
- How to prevent CRPS?
    - **CRPS** – Based on AAOS CPG (moderate) and RCT by Zollinger et al. 2007, incidence of CRPS 10% in placebo, 2% in vitamin C
        
        ![Untitled](4%20Ortho%20Pharmacology%20bebaa569958144ab8bc05704eaf7ffaa/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - **Zollinger** - RCT 416 patients randomized to placebo/ 200/ 500/ 1500mg of vitamin C daily. Placebo group 10% vs Vitamin C group 2.4%. Reccomended dose is 500mg OM x 50 days
    - Dose = 500mg OM x 50 days
    - Also, avoid tight casts, painful manipulations

- How to manage CRPS?
    - Early diagnosis, exclude infection (bloods)
    - Reassure patient
    - Refer PT - for mobilization
    - Refer Pain clinic - anaesthesia for ?sympathetic blockage

### Local Anaesthetics

- How do Local anaesthetics (LA) work?
    - All LA produce effects by **blocking sodium gaited voltage** channels, preventing depolarization of the nerve cell and propagation of action potential down the nerve
- ‼️ Examples of Local Anaesthetics (LA)?
    - **Amides**.
        - **Long acting** - bupivacaine, ropivicaine
        - **Short acting** - lignocaine
        - Vasopressors can be added e.g. adreanline to prolong duration of action
    - **Esters** - cocaine, chlorporcaine, benzocaine - rarely used
- How do you do a Bier's Block? How do you monitor? How do you safeguard for lidocaine toxicity? (#❗️ )
    - First, I will set another IV plug on other arm in case resuscitation is required, ensure crash cart near by.
    - Tourniquet placed on arm
    - Cuff inflated to 100mmHg above patient's SBP
    - LA injected - Dose?
        - Dose = 3mg/kg.
        - **Dilute 1% with equal amount of normal saline to make 0.5%** solution.
            
            
    - Cuff should be inflated for MINIMUM 20-25min post injection, MAXIMUM 60-90min
    - I will deflate briefly for 10 s, then reinflate. If no signs of toxicity after 45s, then deflate again for 5-10 sec. Repeat once more prior to permanently removing it
        - This allows some of the local anaesthetic into the systemic circulation at short intervals to avoid local anaesthetic toxicity from large amounts of local anaesthetic being released all at once.
    - Monitor for toxicity - headache, dizziness, CVS collapse, seizures.
- Why do LA not work in abscess?
    - Infection decreases pH ➔ less effective
    - Infection has increased blood supply ➔ LA removed from area before effect
- How do you treat LA toxicity?
    - Get help from EMD or anaesthesia colleagues
    - ACLS - SLE.
    - ACLS - bag valve mask, low does epinephrine, amiodarone for arrythmias
    - S - seizure supression with benzodiazipine
    - L - Lipid emulsion therapy ith 20% intralipid
    - ECMO

        - **Paralytics** - neuromuscular blockers
- ‼️ How do muscle relaxants/ paralytics work?
    - **Non-depolarizing** blocks binding of acetylcholine to nicotinuc receptors at post-synaptic membrane [competitive inhibitors] e.g. **Atracurium**, Rocuronium
    - **Depolarising -** acts by depolarizing the post synaptic membrane (so there are 2 phases with a initial phase where there is fasciculations) e.g. **Suxamethonium**
- How to reverse muscle relaxants?
    - **Neostigmine** - antagonist to Acetylcholinesterase. Prevents break down of acetylcholine ➔ more acetylcholine at Neuromuscular junction
