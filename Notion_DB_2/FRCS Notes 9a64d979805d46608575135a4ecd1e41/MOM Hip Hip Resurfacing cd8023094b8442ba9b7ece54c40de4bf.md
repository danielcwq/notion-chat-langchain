- What are the advantages of a MOM resurfacing?
    - **Large head size** ➔ higher head neck ratio, PAR, LR, Jump distance
    - **Lubrication** ➔ smooths out itself ("run-in" self-polishing phase), Hydrodynamic lubrication (fluid film. due to Polar contact allowing for fluid entrainment)
    - Bone **preserving** ➔ as less bone needed to be removed for PE lining
    - **Improved wear characteristics** compared to PE
        - MOM particles smaller so reduced osteolysis
        - Total wear also less (1-6 um/ year vs 0-200um for PE)
        - Wear rates of different bearing surfaces

- Disadvantages of MOM hip?
    - Local - **Adverse Reactions to Metal Debris (ARMD**), of which there is a Spectrum of 4 conditions
        - **Metallosis** - metal staining of tissue
        - **Pseudotumor** - granulomatous lesion, neither infective or neoplastic that develops in the vicinity of a THR and resembles a tumor
        - **ALVAL** - aseptic, lymphocyte- dominated vasculitis associated lesion. (HISTOLOGICAL diagnosis)
        - **Macrophage induced osteolysis** due to type 4 hypersensitivity
    - Systemic - increased lead ions may be carcinogenic or teratogenic (No evidence)
- What is the cause of ARMD?
    - Likely **multifactorial**
    - Several studies found association with **increased wear** due to implant positioning and edge loading
    - However, studies also found pseudotumor with minimum wear features, suggesting **hypersensitivity** cause.
    - Pseudotumor reactions also reported in non MOM bearings
- What would make a patient high risk for ARMD?
    - If **Stemmed THR (1)** - femoral head size > 36mm
    - If **Hip resurfacing  (3)** - **all** **females**, **all** depuy ASR hip, Hip resurfacing < 48mm
    - **Technical** factors - **acetabular inclination > 55** degrees
- Why the apparent contradiction in head size for hip resurfacing and THR?
    - For hip resurfacing **< 48mm** ➔ found to have more impingement and edge loading
    - For THR  > 36mm ➔ Found to have more frictional torque and more volumetric wear
- How will you approach a painful MOM hip?
    - Need TRO infection
    - Need TRO extrinsic sources of pain (e.g. referred pain, spine)!
    - Evaluate based on MHRA guidelines
- Follow up for a MOM hip?
    - Based on the MHRA guidelines (Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency)
    - Frequency depends on High risk or Low risk
    - In general, indications for revision would be **high METAL (cobalt and chrome) levels > 7ppb** and **abnormal MRI imaging**.
- ‼️ How do you screen for ARMD in patients with MOM hip?
    - **High risk groups** (regardless of symptoms) and **Low risk symptomatic** - **YEARLY**
        - Oxford Hip score, Clinical symptoms
        - **Annual METAL (Co and Cr)**  levels
        - **MRI** if symptoms or rising lead markers
    - **Low risk asymptomatic** - **annually** for first 5 years, 2 yearly till 10 and 3 yearly thereafter.
        - Oxford Hip score, Clinical symptoms
        - **METAL (Co and Cr)**  levels
        - XR at each visit ➔ if abnormal ➔ MRI
        - **MRI** if symptoms or rising lead markers
- ‼️ What is the classification for MRI findings in Metallic hips?
    - **Anderson classification**
    - A = normal appearances including seromas
    - B = Infection
    - C1 = Mild MOM disease with soft tissue mass **< 5cm**
    - C2 = moderate MOM disease with soft tissue mass **> 5cm,** muscle atrophy
    - C3 = Severe MOM disease with fracture, **tendon avulsion, and bone marrow signal change**

- Do you need to excise every pseudotumor?
    - Based on MHRA guidelines, we should consider revision as long as MRI is abnormal and/or raised metal levels
        
        ![Untitled](MOM%20Hip%20Hip%20Resurfacing%20cd8023094b8442ba9b7ece54c40de4bf/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - However, this is still controversial and There is little knowledge about clinical relavance of silent pseudotumors and its natural course. Also aware that revision outcomes are poor due to incomplete excision or recurrence requiring re-operation.
    - **Walter et al. in JoA 2013** found that pseudotumor prevalance was 36% out of 248 patients. Only 5 who were symptomatic with elevated metal ions were revised.
    - Walter reccomend **revision in Grade C3 + metal ion levels > 7ppb.** Consider follow up with MRI every 6 months until lesion stablity is confirmed.
- What do you expect to find intraop?
    - Presence of "**Dishwater** fluid" with grazy hazy appearance
    - **Black** metal deposits with extensive synovitis
- ‼️ How will you revise a MOM hip?
    - Complex Revision - EEERRR, will enlist help of experienced hip surgeon
    - Concerns are - soft tissue integrity leading to instability, bone loss due to destruction
    - Pre Op
        - Evaluate Pseudotumor destruction
        - MRI CT scan to evaluate bone stock
        - Pseudotumor - may be destructive to periprosthetic bone and soft tissue. Will need to Evaluate bony destruction ➔ KIV **dual mobility, constrained**
        - Templating for bone loss, KIV long implants to bypass defects
    - Intraop
        - Exposure - extensile
        - Extract
        - Evaluate and debride- will need **aggressive debridement** of all involved tissue.
        - Reconstruct - will need to assess
        - Replace
    - Post Op - rehabilitation

## HIP RESURFACING

- Why do People still do Hip resurfacing?
    - Perceived advantages are better restoration of hip biomechanics, better proprioception, improved wear characteristics with no PE induced osteolysis, greater ROM, reduced risk of dislocation, improved femoral bone stock mass
    - Improved wear characteristics compared to PE
        - MOM particles smaller so reduced osteolysis
        - Total wear also less (1-6 um/ year vs 0-200um for PE)
        - Wear rates of different bearing surfaces:

- What are the indications and Contraindications for Hip resurfacing?
    - Ideal patient - young, males who are still active in sports/ manual labour
    - Contraindications -
        - **Patient** factors - severe **osteoporosis**, **females** of child bearing age, severe obesity, **metal allergy,** Kidney disease, steroids (conditions that lead to osteoporosis)
        - **Anatomy** - large cysts in neck, narrow femoral neck, Females with small head (some say < 46mm is contraindication), Hip dysplasia
        - **Pathology** - AVN considered a good indication provided if sufficient healthy bone stock, **DDH and Perthes** are contraindicated
        - **Surgeon** - inexperience
    - Very few are done and should be performed by specialized hip resurfacing surgeon. Should be discussed with hip colleagues and consensus to proceed
- Complications of hip resurfacing?
    - Femoral neck fracture in 4% (varus malposition)
    - MOM issues
    - Aseptic loosening
- Risk factors for hip resurfacing failure?
    - **Patient** - poor bone stock, comorbids like renal failure leading to osteoporosis
    - **Technical** factors - high acetabular inclination > 40 ° ➔ increased wear rates, notching
    - **Implant** - ASR Hip implants (Birmingham hip resurfacing ok)
