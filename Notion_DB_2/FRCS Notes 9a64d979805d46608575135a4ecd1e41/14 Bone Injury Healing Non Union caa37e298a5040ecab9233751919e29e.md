- What is Perren's Strain Theory?
    - Strain = relative change in fracture gap over original gap
    - If strain **< 2 %** = absolute stability = primary bone healing
    - If strain **2-10%** = secondary bone healing
    - If strain **10-17%** = fibrous nonunion
    - If strain **> 17%** = non union; granulation tissue
- Primary Bone healing?
    - NO FRACTURE CALLUS
    - Primary bone healing occurs via 2 mechanisms
    - **Contact Healing** [gap <0.01mm] ➔ cutting cones (no need lay down bone already)
    - **Gap healing** [gap <1mm] ➔ direct laying down of lamellar bone **and** subsequent remodelling with cutting cones
- Draw cutting cone?

    - 3 zones - **cutting** zone, **reversal** zone, **closing** zone
        - **Cutting** zone - **osteoclasts** cut into the bone
        - **Reversal** zone - **transition** to having more **osteoblasts**
            - Precursor cells and presence of capillaries to bring nutrition
        - **Closing** zone
            - Mainly **osteoblasts** lining the cone and laying down bone
            - Osteoblasts becomes **entombed** in new bone to form **osteocytes**
    - Osteoclastic tunnelling, followed by capillaries and layering of osteoblasts
- What is Secondary Bone healing?
    - **Inflammatory** – haematoma with release of cytokines, migration of cells ; angiogenesis
    - **Soft** callus - this can be via
        - **Intramembranous ossification** under periosteum at bone edges. Osteoid (type 1 collgen) laid down directly from periosteal osteoblasts in the inner cambium layer. This is hard callus but does not bridge the fracture site. (*bone without cartilage* by osteoprogenitor cells)
        - **Endochondral ossification** (cartilage first by **chondroblasts**) - this is  type 2 cartiliginous collagen.
            
            ![Untitled](14%20Bone%20Injury%20Healing%20Non%20Union%20caa37e298a5040ecab9233751919e29e/Untitled%201.png)
            
    - **Hard** callus = chondroclasts break down callus and osteoblasts lay down osteoid
    - **Remodelling** of woven bone into lamellar bone via cutting cones
- ‼️ What Factors affect Bone healing? What concept?
    
    ![Untitled](14%20Bone%20Injury%20Healing%20Non%20Union%20caa37e298a5040ecab9233751919e29e/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - "Factors can be divided into osteoinductive, osteogenic, osteoconductive matrix and mechanical stabillity as put forth by **Giannoudis** as the diamond concept"
    - **Osteoinductive** - growth factors e.g. BMP when indicated
    - **Osteogenic** - Presence of bone grafts
    - **Osteoconductive** - insufficient structural graft
    - Mechanical **stability** - implant choice, fixation technique
    - **Host** factors - co-morbids DM, steroids
    - **Vascularity** - PVD
    - These 6 factors contribute to the creation of a “Bio-reactor”
- What is the unified bone healing theory?
    - It is a recent theory put forth by **Elliot et al.** that suggests that the tissue that forms in and around a fracture should be considered a specific functional entity - **“bone healing unit” (BHU)** which responds to forces and functions according to various laws - perren strain theory, wolff’s law and “mechanostat”
    
    [A unified theory of bone healing and nonunion: BHN theory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27365465/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20this%20theory,the%20normal%20healing%20of%20bone)
    

## NON-UNION

- What is non union?
    - FDA 1988 definition either >9 month not healed, OR no progress in last 3 months
- Types of nonunion?
    - Infected
    - Aseptic
        - Hypertrophic = stability problem
        - Atrophic = biological problem
- Management of aseptic non union?
    - Going by the factors that affect union as laid out By Giannoudis via the diamond concept, I would like to consider factors affecting
        - **Osteogenesis** - this will involve **optimising the patient** in terms of DM,PVD, control to ensure good vasularity to fracture site; use of autologus bone grafts will help in OG, OI, OC
        - **Osteoinductive** - use of BMP 2 and 7
        - **Osteoconductive** - use of autografts
        - **Stability** - augment fixation with plate, exchange nail,
    - Example - femur shaft fracture non union
        
        ![Untitled](14%20Bone%20Injury%20Healing%20Non%20Union%20caa37e298a5040ecab9233751919e29e/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - Rule out infection - bloods, Metsemaker's criteria
        - Hypetrophic non union, issue with stability
- Hypertrophic non union in an initially stable fixation?
    
    ![Untitled](14%20Bone%20Injury%20Healing%20Non%20Union%20caa37e298a5040ecab9233751919e29e/Untitled%204.png)
    
    - Why in this case the fixation is quite stiff - short working length and high screw density yet went into hypertrophic non union. This XR was taken 1 year after/
    - THe hypertrophy may have occured after the screw broke leading to higher instability

## BONE GRAFTING

- What are the properties of Bone graft?
    - OG, OI, OC

### AUTOGRAFTS

- Types of Autografts?
    - Can be divided into Cortical vs Cancellous vs Corticocancellous vs vascularised bone graft
    - **Cancellous bone** - rich in mesenchymal stem cells with high osteogenic and osteoconductive potetial; trabecular structure allow rapid revascularization
    - **Cortical** - more structural but revascularization takes longer, lower osteogenic and osteoinductive porperties
    - **Corticocancellous** - best of both
- ‼️ What are the **stages of graft incorporation?**
    - Depends on Type of bone
    - **Cancellous** bone = By Creeping substitiution (3 stages) [**No callus** as no endochondral ossification]]
        - 1:  **Vascular** ingrowth
        - 2: Osteoblasts lay new bone with simultaneous **stochastic** (aka random) resorption (Creeping Substitution)
        - 3: Remodelling via cutting cones
    - **Cortical** bone = Osteoclastic resorption (3 stages)
        - In contrast to cancellous bone, **NOT entire graft is incorporated and no remodelling occurs**
        - **1. Osteoclastic resorption** via cutting cones into graft so 60% strength lost in first 6 months! (Principle is that all donor bone has to be removed before new bone formation)
        - **2. Initial incorporation** at bone-graft junction via endchondral bone formation [**Presence of Callus]**
        - **3. Ingrowth** of osteons via intramembranous ossification / appositional bone growth
        - Allografts also undergo similar process but more slowly
- What factors affect graft incorporation?
    - **Quality of host bed** - infection, vascularity, previous irradiation, immunocompromise
    - **Mechanical** environment of graft - stability
    - **Inflammatory** response - NSAIDS may delay response
- How do you harvest iliac crest bone graft?
    
    ![Untitled](14%20Bone%20Injury%20Healing%20Non%20Union%20caa37e298a5040ecab9233751919e29e/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - Can take from anterior or posterior iliac crest - anterior less graft (15ml vs 25ml)
    - Anterior - avoid LFCN
    - Skin incision parallel to iliac crest, 3cm proximal to ASIS to avoid LFCN
    - Elevate EO muscles
- RIA vs ICBG
    - RIA higher volume 40ml vs 25ml
    - (+) lower overall pain scores.
    - (-) more blood loss, need special instruments
    - (-) risk of iatrogenic fractures
- How can you treat donor site pain over iliac crest?
    - Superior **cluneal nerve blocks** (L1-L3 dorsal rami pure sensory nerves)

### ALLOGRAFTS

- ‼️ Tell me about allograft processing?
    - Two components of processing
    - 1. **Aseptic** processing -  physical debridement,  sonic debridement, Ethanol, Antibiotic ➔ then packed in its final package
    - 2. **Terminal** Sterilization
        - In terminal sterilization, tissue is sterilized **in its final package.**
        - Allografts may be terminally sterilized by several methods, including ethylene oxide, gamma radiation, electron (E)-beam radiation, and hydrogen peroxide plasma.
        - Most common - gamma radiation
- ⚠️ What preservation methods of allografts?
    - **Fresh vs Fresh frozen vs freeze dried**
    - Fresh - Maintain at 4 degrees, store **1 week.** highest antigenicity, viable cell population with some growth factors
    - Fresh frozen - less immunogenic than fresh, **preserves BMP** [last **1 year** at -20 °, **5 years** at -70 ° ]
    - Freeze dried **least immunogenic**, loss of structural integrity, depleted BMPs [Indefinite shelf life]
    - Cryopreservation - **cell viability** 10-40% at -160 ° in glycerol containing medium

### DBM

- ‼️ What is Demineralized Bone matrix DBM?
    - It is bone processed with acid extraction to **remove minerals** , leaving with collagenous and non collagenous structure and proteins
    - Comes in the form of Gels and Putties
- Properties of DBM?
    - Osteoconductive. OI is debated.

### BMP

- What is Bone Morphogenic protein?
    - It is an osteoinductive growth factors that stimulate bone growth
    - Commonly use BMP 2 and 7, currently mainly used in tibia fractures

- What are the complications of BMP?
    - Early complications
        - **Seroma** formation so keep the drain for longer period; avoid in cervical spine surgeries
        - Can cause **radiculitis** –inflammation around nerve roots. (Jacob Oh likes to mention retrograde ejaculation if irritate the hypogastric nerve in ALIF)
    - Late complications
        - Can cause **ectopic bone** formation ➔ cause compression
        - Can lead to **osteolysis**
        - Risk of **malignancy**, avoid in patients with risk of Ca
            - Contraindicated in patients in skeletal immature

### BONE SUBSTITUTES

- Examples of Bone substitutes
    - Calcium sulphate - absorbs within weeks!
    - Calcium **phosphate** - ceramics. Comes in cement form
    - Calcium Carbonate - Coralline/ Hydroxyapatite.
        
        ![Untitled](14%20Bone%20Injury%20Healing%20Non%20Union%20caa37e298a5040ecab9233751919e29e/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - **Tricalcium** **Phosphate** [Chronos] - converts into hydroxyapatite after implantation
        - It has structural properties and resorbs over 6-18 month
        - Comes with various sizes, shapes
        
        ![Untitled](14%20Bone%20Injury%20Healing%20Non%20Union%20caa37e298a5040ecab9233751919e29e/Untitled%207.png)
        
- Which bone substitute do you use in your practice?
    - Chronos - Tricalcium phosphate bone blocks ➔ partially converts to Calcium Hydroxyapatite, absorbs over **6-18 months** (unlike calcium suphate that is absorbed within weeks, unable to provide structural support)
    - Norain - calcium phosphate
