### Shoulder OA

- How do you differentiate from Cuff tear arthropathy?
    - Clinically - RC strength
    - XR - migration?
- How to differentiate from RA?
    - Pattern of Glenoid wear
    - OA = posterior
    - RA = Central
- What imaging investigation?
    - XR – goat’s beard
    - CT scan – evaluate bone stock
    - MRI – prognosticate RC insufficiency after TSA
    - [Young et al. 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22419408/) – Preop fatty infiltration of IS muscle is prognostic of RC dysfunction
- ‼️ How will you classify?
    - **Walch** for glenoid wear

    - A = concentric joint
    - B = **posterior** wear
    - C = Glenoid **retroversion**
    - D = Glenoid anterior wear with anteversion
- What is the rate of secondary RC tear after TSA?
    - [Young et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22419408/) – Rate of secondary RC dysfunction after TSA ~ **16%** in 10 years
    - Outcomes 10 year survival 93%
    - RTSA if presence of RC tear

### Milwaukee Shoulder

- XR of a destructive shoulder. What are the possible Ddx?
    - Infection - TB
        
        ![Untitled](Shoulder%20OA%20AVN%20Milwaukee%20Charcot%20ACJ%20OA%20b2bc20fb6e214aeabce7181a7dfbbc6b/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Trauma - severe malunion and collapse
    - AVN of shoulder
    - Neurological - Charcot's
- What is Milwaukee Shoulder?
    - it is a destructive, calcium hydroxyapatite crystalline arthropathy
    - Associated with Rotator cuff defects and histology will have numerous aggregates of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals
- How do they present?
    - Rapid onset of painful swelling
- Investigations?
    - XR - OA features with rapid destruction
    - Aspiration - Haemorrhagic fluid
- What is a special stain to diagnose Milwaukee shoulder?
    - Special stain = **Alizarin Red S Stain** for Calcium Hydroxyapatite Crystals
    - Can sometimes also contain CPPD crystals (positive birefringent rhomboid crystals) [Mixed Calcium phosphate Deposition Disease]
- Mx?
    - Supportive
    - Rest, NSAIDS
    - Colchicine shown to be effective
    - PT to maintain ROM.

### Charcot Shoulder and Elbow

- What is the most common cause?
    - Syringomyelia
    - Occurs in 25% of patients with syringomyelia; 75% of Charcot shoulder is syringomyelia
- Investigation?
    - XR shoulder
    - MRI Cervical spine!
    - Joint aspiration TRO infection
- Surgical Management for Charcot **Shoulder**?
    - Ensure NES review and decompression of syrinx cavity to prevent deterioration before surgical treatment
    - **Arthrodesis**
        - Historically treatment of choice but recent studies show poor outcomes
    - **Arthroplasty**
        - **Previously contraindicated** in neuropathic joints but now used in disparate conditions
        - Hemiarthroplasty + RC repair
            - Case series by Matsuhashi et al. JSES 2011. 8 year follow up for 3 patients with syringomyelia. No dislocations with improvement in ROM
        - RTSA
            - Case report by Ueblacker et al. in JSES 2006 of bilateral RTSA for severe syringomelia and demonstrated survival at 26 and 30 months. Giving a marked improvement in ROM
            
            ![Untitled](Shoulder%20OA%20AVN%20Milwaukee%20Charcot%20ACJ%20OA%20b2bc20fb6e214aeabce7181a7dfbbc6b/Untitled%204.png)
            
- Surgical management of charcot **elbow**?
    - **Arthrodesis** is mainstay
        - James Tan et al. Shoulder and Elbow 2015. Case report of neuropathic arthropathy fused with double Posterior. + medial plate and bone grafting in a domestic helper.
    - **Resection** Arthroplasty
        - Kwon and Morrey et al. JSES 2006. Case series of 4 resection arthroplasty. 3 has gross instability but with good functional use of elbow.
- What is shoulder arthrodesis position?
    - 30/30/30
    - Flexion 30, abduction 30, IR 30

### Shoulder AVN

- Causes?
    - Post- traumatic
    - atraumatic (steroids..)
- ‼️ What classification for shoulder AVN?
    - Cruess
    - Similar to Steinberg - 3 is crescent, 4 is collapse 5 is OA
        
        ![Untitled](Shoulder%20OA%20AVN%20Milwaukee%20Charcot%20ACJ%20OA%20b2bc20fb6e214aeabce7181a7dfbbc6b/Untitled%205.png)
        
- Management?
    - Joint preserving – core decompression
    - Joint sacrificing – hemi, TSA

### ACJ Arthritis

- What is unique about the ACJ?
    - it is synovial joint with a fibrocartilaginous disc
- Surgical management?
    - Mumford procedure which is a distal clavicle excision
    - Need to retain the superior and posterior capsule to maintain stability of the ACJ
