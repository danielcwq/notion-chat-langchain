### Hallux Rigidus (‼️)

![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled.png)

- What are risk factors of hallux rigidus?
    - Long first ray
    - Metatarsus Primus Elevatus - dorsiflexed 1st MT (controversial)
        
        ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - Pes Planus
    - high heels
    - Previous gout, Hallux valgus
- What to see on XR?
    - XR - toe, dorsal osteophyte, extent of joint narrowing
    
    ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%202.png)
    
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the classification for Hallux Rigidus?
    - **Coughlin and Shurnas (clinical and radiological)**
    - Grade 1 = Mild
    - Grade 2 = XR **< 50%** narrowing
    - Grade 3 = XR **> 50% narrowing** (no pain during ROM; only terminal)
    - Grade 4 = **pain at mid ROM** (severe arthritis)
- What is the special insole for non operative management?
    - Stiff soled shoe/ Morton extension
- ‼️ What are the surgical options for hallux rigidus?
    - ***Cheilectomy KIV moberg vs Osteotomies vs Fusion vs Arthroplasty***
    - **Cheilectomy KIV Moberg osteotomy**
        - Excision of **30%** of dorsal joint surface ➔ if insufficient correction ➔ moberg P1 dorsiflexion (dorsal closing wedge) osteotomy
            
            ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%203.png)
            
        - ~ 10% need fusion in 10 years.
        - Option of MIS ➔ risk of EHL rupture
    - **Distal Meta-tarsal osteotomies**
        - These osteotomies aim to obtain longitudinal decompression of the joint by proximal translation of the MT head and plantar flexing as desired.
            - **Shortening** - allows the surrounding soft tissues to relax and remodel.
            - **Plantar flexion** reduces the dorsal impingement between the metatarsal head and the base of the phalanx, which limits the hallux dorsiflexion and produces the dorsal chondral lesion of the head itself.
                - This address Metatasus Primus Elevatus
                
                ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%204.png)
                
        - Examples -
            - Weil's shortening Osteotomy
                - Cerccarini et al. 2015 FAI - case series of 40 Weil's shortening ostetomy ➔ good results with preservation of motion.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%205.png)
                    
            - Youngswick osteotomy
                
                ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%206.png)
                
    - **Fusion**- **only if IPJ is not stiff!!**
        - Ensure IPJ is flexible
        - **Approach** – medial or dorsal incision; protect the **dorsomedial cutaneous nerve**
        - **Technique**
            - Remove subchondral bone. Avoid excessive shortening. If shortened ➔ bone graft (shortening leads to violation of parabola and transfer metatarsalgia)
            - Hardware: **screw + dorsal low profile plate**
        - Position = Dorsiflexion 10 ° for females high heel, neutral rotation.
    - Implant **arthroplasty** (controversial)
        - **Cartiva** resurfacing arthroplasty – synthetic polyvinyl alcohol
            
            ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%207.png)
            
        - Pros – joint preserving
        - 2017 RCT FAI – Outcomes – no difference from union
    - Salvage procedures
        - Bone block arthrodesis to prevent shortening of 1MT and resulting transfer metatarsalgia
    - ✘ Keller resection arthroplasty (low function)
- What is the technique of fusion?
    - **“Dorsal plate + screw combo”** has been found to be the most stable construct
    - **Joel Politi** et al. compared screw only, K-wires, Plate only and plate + screw combo

- How do you check the fusion angle intraop?
    - Use a flat surface intraop, press on the foot ➔ pulp should be lifted up **5mm**
    - 20 ° dorsiflexion with reference from the 1st MT.

### Hallux Valgus (‼️)

- What is Hallux Valgus?
    - **3-Dimensional** deformity with Lateral deviation of great toe, medial deviation of 1st MT and pronation deformity
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the Pathogenesis of hallux valgus?
    - Perara Current concepts review JBJS 2011
    - 1. Failure of **medial** supporting structures joint capsule is “early and essential step”
    - 2. **Bone** – MT head drift medially, PP moves laterally (valgus)
    - 3. **Muscles** Deformity – , EHL and FHL act as bowstring and act as adductors together with AdH; Sesamoids articulate with lateral MT head
    - 4. MT head drop off sesamoid, causing **pronation and plantar flexion**
    - 5. **Contracture** – Lateral joint capsule and intrinsics contracts

- What causes hammer toes in hallux valgus?
    - Defunctioning of first ray ➔ **Transfer metatarslagia** ➔ Stress on 2nd MT ➔ Plantar plate rupture ➔ dorsiflexion of Proximal phalanx ➔ Hammer toe
    
    ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%208.png)
    
- What are the risk factors of HV?
    - **Non- Modifiable** Female, family history, ligamentous laxity, Pes planus, tight TA, Underlying conditions (**RA**, cerebral palsy)
    - **Modifiable** High heel, narrow toe box
- Causes of HV?
    - **Intrinsic** causes = idiopathic, familial, hyperlaxity, Inflammatory (RA, Gout), Neuromuscular
    - **Extrinsic** (acquired) = due to tight foot wear
- Hx? What kind of pain?
    - **Extrinsic** pain = pain due to deformity and pressure
    - **Intrinsic** pain = pain due to degeneration, synovitis
- ‼️ Invx for hallux valgus? What are the cut off angles?
    - "Weight bearing AP and Lateral XR"
    - **XR** – 4 angles
        - **HVA** [15 ° ], **IMA** [10 °], **DMAA** [10 °], **IPA** [10 °]
            
            ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%209.png)
            
        
    - Congruency - based on DMAA
        
        ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2010.png)
        
        - Most are incongruent (DMAA < 10 °)**I**
- ‼️ Significance of congruity in hallux valgus?
    - Most are non congruent (DMAA < 10); so after correction, it becomes congruent and well aligned.
    - If congruent, (DMAA > 10); osteotomy itself will cause it to be unaligned. So will need **double osteotomy**
    - **Congruent** = Proximal correction will worsen it.
        
        ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2011.png)
        
        - Will need double osteotomy.
        - Medial closing wedge to correct DMAA first
        - Followed by a proximal scarf osteotomy
    - Incongruent = proximal correction will correct it.
        - "meaning that proximal phalanx can be rolled medially on metatarsal head to achieve correction of deformity"
            
            ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2012.png)
            
- ‼️ Classifx of hallux valgus?
    - **Classifx** by Severity by HVA and IMA angles (based on JBJS review by Robinson et al. 2007)
        - Mild HVA < 20 °. IMA < 13
        - Moderate 21 °- 40 °, IMA 14-20
        - Severe > 40 °, IMA > 20
        
        ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2013.png)
        
- Non op Mx?
    - Wide shoe box, toe spacer
- Surgical algorithm? 3 questions?
    - Do I need to **fuse**? - TMTJ OA or MTPJ OA?
    - How big the **correction** do I need?
    - Do I need to **correct IPA**? ➔ Akin's osteotomy
    - Do I need to **release gastroc**?
- What types of osteotomies do you know?
    - Distal osteotomy = **Chevron**
    - Proximal osteotomy = **Scarf**
- ‼️ ⚠️ Surgery Sequence? (5 steps)
    - “Combination of soft tissue and bony procedures”
    - Supine, tourniquet.
    1. **Lateral release** (Modified Mcbride) first to mobilize sesamoid via dorsal incision (can be done as a second incision over 1st web space or through the medial incision)
    2. **Bony** Correction as required Scarf Osteotomy – “aim to place MT over sesamoid and achieve balance”
    3. KIV Akin’s osteotomy
    4. **Medial tissue debridement** + capsular stabilization – **reef** the attenuated medial capsule
    5. KIV **Gastroc release** if silverskoid  positive. 
- ‼️ How do you do a lateral release? What 4 structures?
    - Dorsal incision in the 1st web space at level of 1st MTPJ (separate from osteotomy incision) OR go through osteotomy trans-metatarsal
    - Release varies from surgeon to surgeon but include
        - Metatarso-sesamoid suspensory ligament (from MTPJ to sesamoids)
        - Phalangeal insertion band (from PP base to fibular sesamoid)
        - Adductor hallucis tendon
        - Deep transverse metatarsal ligament
        
        [Lateral release via medial.pdf](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Lateral_release_via_medial.pdf)
        
- How do you do a Scarf osteotomy?
    - Medial longitudinal incision along midline of medial border of foot
    - Protect medial dorsal cutaneous nerve (branch of SPN)
    - Capsule divided and reflected dorsally - not plantarly to protect plantar artery
    - Z-cut osteotomy - to prevent troughing, Coetzee 2003 reccomend that vertical limbs be only through cortical bone and not in cancellous bone
        
        ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2014.png)
        
    - Fix with variable pitch screws
- How do you do a Chevron osteotomy?
    - V-shaped, extra-capsular, Distal 60 ° angle cut
    - Lateral shift up t
- How do you do a akin osteotomy?
    - Medial closing wedge osteotomy of proximal phalanx to address high Interphalangeus Angle
        
        ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2015.png)
        
    - Cut must be perpendicular to phalanx to prevent PF or DF
    - Avoid "cock -up" deformity by protecting the FHL tendon
    - Fix with screw or staple
- What is troughing?
    - Troughing is impaction of 2 osteotomy fragments, whereby the hard cortical bone impacts into soft cancellous bone, resulting in loss of MT height and malrotation.
    - To prevent troughing, Coetzee 2003 reccomend that vertical limbs be only through cortical bone and not in cancellous bone
        
        ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- What is a modified Lapidus? Indication? What is the modifiation?
    - Lapidus Fusion indication = TMTJ OA, Hypermobile 1st ray, Primus Varus (large deformity)
    - Modified Lapidus = isolated fusion of **1TMTJ** (original included fusion of 1+2MT)
    
    ![Original lapidus](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2017.png)
    
    Original lapidus
    
    ![Modified lapidus](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2018.png)
    
    Modified lapidus
    
- Historical Procedures?
    - Keller’s resection arthroplasty ➔ low demand
    - Simple bunionectomy alone not recommended --> 41% patients dissatisfied.
- ‼️ What are the **complications** of the surgery?
    - Divided into early vs Late
    - Early complications
        - **Dorsomedial branch of SPN** injury ➔ numbness over medial aspect of toe
        - Infection
    - Late
        - Recurrence
        - Painful neuroma from injury to Dorsal medial cutaneous nerve
        - Hallux varus deformity - avoid resection of fibula sesamoid
        - **AVN** rates 0-20%. Blood supply laterally from 1st Dorsal and plantar MT artery; medially from **medial *plantar* artery**. So, Prevention (2)
            - 1. Avoid **plantar** dissection
            - 2. Saw blade pass through but not beyond lateral cortex
                
                ![Untitled](Hallux%20Disease%20-%20Rigidus,%20Valgus%20b26679e226814ad2aaaed454f3cab4cd/Untitled%2019.png)
                
- How do you address hallux varus?
    - If flexible ➔ Abductor hallucis release, medial capsule release
    - Salvage - MTPJ arthrodesis

## JUVENILE Hallux Valgus

- Risk factors for juvenile HV?
    - High incidence of Family history - X-linked dominant/ Autosomal dominant with variable penetrance
- How can you differentiate Juvenile HV and adult HV?
    - **Angles** - large IMA with metarsus primus varus (etiology is the TMTJ)
    - DMAA is typically increased (**congruent** HV)
    - Presence of **laxity** - 1st ray laxity, Beighton +
    - **NO PAIN**
    - Often BILATERAL
- How do you evaluate young patient with Juvenile HV?
    - Need TRO **central causes** of muscle imbalances e.g. Cerebral palsy, look at spine for **spinal dysraphism**
- Management of Juvenile HV?
    - Pursue Non operative until physis closes
    - Treat like for adult HV when physis closed ➔ due to hyperlaxity may need lapidus procedure
