- What are the causes of Ankle Arthritis?
    - Causes - **primary** vs **Secondary** OA
    - Post traumatic OA most common, inflammatory (RA), infection, hemophilia
- ‼️ What is the classification for ankle OA?
    - **Classifx** - **Takakura** - medial joint Contact first
    - 1 = No tilt, some sclerosis and cysts
    - 2 = Tibiotalar tilt; **no contact**
    - 3 = Bone **contact**
        - 3A = **medial** only
        - 3B = **dome** contact
    - 4 = **total contact**

- ‼️ What clinical findings in Ankle OA?
    - Gait - loss of second rocker. Walks with **abducted** foot to circumvent stiff ankle
    - Assess for alignment - valgus hindfoot
    - Assess for **stability** - TAR require intact ligaments
    - Check Neurovascular status! Check PULSE!
    - Check for adjacent Joint pain/ flexibility - Subtalar joint and Talonavicular joint
- What is the non op management?
    - Stiff, rocker bottom shoe - Mechanism is to offload second ankle rocker
- ‼️ How do you surgically manage Ankle OA?
    - Joint preserving vs Joint sacrificing (Fusion vs replacement)
    - **Joint Preserving Options**
        - Supramalleolar osteotomy - medial opening vs lateral closing osteotomy
        - Distraction arthroplasty - frame for 3/12
        - Arthroscopic debridement and anterior cheilectomy
    - **Joing Sacrificing:**
        - Ankle Fusion
        - **Total Ankle Replacement**
- How can you know if ankle fusion will be beneficial for this patient?
    - Wear a Ankle Brace **(high lace up shoes)** for a few weeks to see if pain improves
- How do you do **ankle Fusion**?
    - Techniques/ Devices
        - Intramedullary devices (TTC nail)
        - Extramedullary devices (screws, plates)
        - External fixation
    - Approaches - open vs Scope
        - **Arthroscopic** (suitable if < 15 ° angulation but more recent studies say no difference < 15 or > 15)
        - **Open** – ****
            - Screw fixation (sparing the fibula)

            - **Lateral transfibular approach** with fibular onlay graft, Anterior approach

- ⚠️ ⚠️ What is the position of fusion?
    - **Position** = **Plantigrade with 5 ° ER and 5° valgus** with **slight posterior translation** of talus (Increase Surface area and reduce lever arm of foot)
- ⚠️ Why is talus shifted posteriorly?
    1. Increases **surface area** for fusion
    2. It increases the lever arm of the tendoachilles and **reduces the lever arm of the ground reaction forces on the subtalar joint**
        1. Overall, this will reduce the joint reaction forces in the subtalar joint!

- Ankle Arthritis - Difference between open vs arthroscopic fusion?
    - **Townsend** et al. JBJS 2013 Comparative Case Series showed both Open and Arthroscopic arthrodesis significant improvement in pain and function
    - Arthroscopic resulted in shorter hospital stay and showed better outcomes at 1 and 2 year
    - Arthroscopic Proposed advantages
        - Lower complications rates
        - Shorter time to union
        - Theoretically maintain periarticular blood supply which enhances fusion and facilitate more rapid repair
        - Advantage is you can leave fibula intact, allowing for fusion take down and conversion to TAR. TAR requires intact fibula!
    - Classic contraindications to arthroscopic • large deformities that need concomittant osteotomy

- What is the ideal screw position and number for fusion?
    - **3 parallel screws** have been found to give the highest rates of union
    - 3 screws better than 2 screws with parallel screws, better than crossed with more compression
    - With “home run” Posterolateral tibia screw into talar neck [beware sural nerve]

- Complications of ankle fusion?
    - adjacent joint disease, gait - loss of 2nd rocker requiring shoe wear modification
- What is the ideal candidate for **ankle replacement**?
    - Ideal patient = elderly, low demand, no instability, no deformity, good bone stock, no NV deficit. Rheumatoid Arthritis Ankle is ideal.
- What are the generations of ankle replacement?
    - **3 Generations of TAR**
    - 1 = Cemented, **2** components - tibia PE (monoblock), Talar metal (monoblock)
    - 2 = Uncemented, **3** components with modular, FIXED PE bearing
    - 3 = Uncemented, **3** components with MOBILE PE bearing

- What approach for Ankle Replacement?
    - Surgical Approach - **Anterior EHL// EDL**
    - [Ankle/ Distal Tibia Approaches](Ankle%20Distal%20Tibia%20Approaches%20725fb43f604a47fdab976bccbaebc84b.md)
- Complications of ankle replacement?
    - Subsidence – Mx = fusion with structural allograft
    - Loosening
- What is the outcomes of TAR?
    - Haddad 2007 Systematic review – 10 year survival 77%

- Ankle fusion vs replacement?
    - Ankle arthrodesis long been gold standard of treatment for ankle arthritis
    - JBJS Systematic review 2007 Haddad et al. - Intermediate **functional** outcomes (5-10 year survival rates) appears similar to ankle arthrodesis, **Revision** rates similar. Sparse results

    - Theoretically:
        - **Arthroplasty Pros:**
            - Improved gait with increased stride length, cadence and stride velocity
            - Prolongs/ prevents progression of arthritis in adjacent joints
            - Arthrodesis can be used as salvage
        - **Arthrodesis**
            - Cons: Increased risk of ipsilateral mid foot and hindfoot degeneration
- When can one return to driving?
    - 90% of patients achieve safe braking reaction time within 6 weeks of TAA; by **9 weeks all meet the brake-reaction time**

- What is the return to sports rate for ankle and foot fusions?
    - Decision to return to sports dependant on many elements
    - 1. Arthrodesis may place excessive burden on surrounding joints ➔ lead to pain and early arthritis
    - 2. Arthrodesis leads to longer rigid arm ➔ result in stress fractures above or below the site
    - 3. Arthrodesis iteself placed under excessive stress ➔ pseudoarthrosis and failure
    - 4. Some sports precluded simply because the arthrodesis renders individual incapable of performing the fundamental motion of the sports e.g. jumping in ankle fusion.

- Any difference in return to sports rate for TAR vs fusion?
    - No difference in mid term follow up of 2 years

## ANKLE IMPINGEMENT

- What are the types of ankle impingement?
    - Anterior - pain with dorsiflexion
    - Posterior - Os trigonum syndrome, FHL synovitis
- What classification for Ankle Anterior Impingement?
    - Grade 1 = synovial impingement with < 3mm tibia spur
    - Grade 2 = Tibia spur > 3mm
    - Grade 3 = significant tibial exostosis with or without fragmentation
    - Grade 4 = Tibiotalar arthritic destruction (cannot do arthroscopic debridement)
