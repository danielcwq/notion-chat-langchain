### Cervical Anterior Smith Robinson Approach

- Focus on patient preparation‼️
    - P - Supine, sand bag under shoulder blades, head neutral with slight tilt only to maintain straight line, elevated 30 °
    - **Strap down shoulders** to help with II visualization
    - Tape the head down at forehead to stabilize
- Dangerous structures - (think by layers)
    - Platysma - External jugular vein
    - Pretracheal fascia - Superior and inferior thyroid arteries
    - Tracheo-esophageal groove - RLN
    - Along longus colli - Sympathetic chain
- D - RLN nerve, Sympathetics, thyroid Arteries
- Localise Clinically and radiologically
    - Hard palate C1
    - Angle of mandilbe C2
    - Hyoid Cartilage C3 [**HTC** phone]
    - Thyroid Cartilage C4-5
    - Cricoid Cartilage C6
- I - horizontal incision at level from **posterior border of SCM to midline**
- D - Split platysma vertically ➔ identify anterior border of SCM [innervated by Spinal Accessory nerve] ➔ incise **DEEP CERVICAL FASCIA ➔** Strap muscles retracted medially ➔ identify Carotid sheath (with vagus nerve inside) ➔ incise **PRETRACHEAL FASCIA** medial to carotid sheath **➔** Retract carotid laterally, trachea, oesophagus medially ➔ ligate **inferior thyroid arteries** ➔ locate vertebral body (localise again) ➔ incise **PREVERTEBRAL FASCIA** to expose anterior surface ➔ place retractors under longus colli muscles to protect sympathetic chain on the longus colli
- Left side RLN more predictable but right side easier for right handers
- **Thoracic Duct** is on the left side

### Lumbar Posterior Approach

- Focus on patient preparation‼️
    - Appropriate padding from top to bottom (protect 5 nerves)
        - **Orbital** padding to prevent pressure on eyes, supraorbital nerve
        - **Elbow** - flex and pad medial epicondyle to protect ulnar nerve
        - **Sciatic** nerve - knees bent to reduce tension
        - **Femoral** nerve, LFCN - appropriate padding at ASIS
    - Abdomen - hang free to prevent venous pooling in the batson’s valveless system
    - P - prone on jackson table (if require lordosis) or wilson frame (if want to open up interlaminar space)
    - Localisation with II
    - I - midline incision over spinous process
    - D - incise thorugh lumbodorsal fascia; paraspinal muscles (multifidus, Logissimus, iliocostalis)detached subperiosteally as one unit using Cobb elevators as far as **facet joints**
    
    - What is the anatomy of the ligamentum flavum? How do you do a flavectomy?
        - Anatomy
            - Superior - Arises from the ventral surface, at 50% of the cranial lamina
            - Inferior - Attaches to the leading/ superior edge of the inferior lamina
            - Medially - no attachment
            - Lateral border - **medial border of the inferior articulating facet**
        - Flavectomy
            - You can either approach superiorly or inferiorly
            - I will use a blunt currette to free the inferior edge from the inferior lamina
            - Next, use kerrison ronguer to remove distal end of the superior lamina to reveal attachment of the ligamentum flavum
            - Continue to use ronguer to gently ronguer off the ligamentum flvum

    - Proceed with laminotomy or laminectomy

### Lumbar Posterior Wiltse Approach

- Incision is **3 cm lateral to midline**
- Wiltse approach is muscle splitting between **multifidus and Longissimus**

- Suitable levels?
    - Primarily for L5/S1
    - L4/5 ➔ less so due to bifurcation of vessels (may need vascular surgeon)
    - Proximal to that also less due to risk of SMA thrombosis and retraction
- 2 types of incisions
    - Midline for all levels (umbilicus to symphysis)
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.04.39 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.04.39_PM.png)
        
    - L5/S1 - mini-pfannetial
- **TRANSPERITONEAL**: Supine position, Catherize patient ➔ Incise linea alba ➔ Rectus sheath divided ➔ Transversalis Fascia incised → Peritoneum picked up and incised ➔ sweep bowel away ➔ incise posterior peritoneum in midline over sacral promontory
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.04.57 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.04.57_PM.png)

    ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.06.53 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.06.53_PM.png)
    
- **RETROPERITONEAL:** Supine position, Catherize patient ➔ Incise ➔ Rectus sheath divided ➔ Transversalis Fascia incised →Blunt dissection to develop plane towards lower quadrant to encounter retroperitoneal fat and sweep everything to the side
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.11.20 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.11.20_PM.png)
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.11.41 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.11.41_PM.png)
    
- Adv - efficient disc space clearance and end plays prep, allows maximisation of implant size and surface area, allow good correction of lordosis

### Lumbar - AnteroLateral Retroperitoneal Approach

- P - lateral position, can use AMSCO table to break table
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.13.12 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.13.12_PM.png)
    
- I - **12th rib** and oblique towards the **lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle** about 5cm lateral to midline
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.13.56 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.13.56_PM.png)
    
- S - Skin ➔ Subcut ➔ 3 muscles - EO, IO, TF ➔ Plane between retroperitoneal fat and fascia that overlies the psoas muscle ➔ sweep everything anteriorly ➔ ligate lumbar vessels from aorta to mobilize it anteriorly

### Lumbar Fusion Approaches

![Untitled](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Untitled%202.png)

- **PLF** without instrumentation
    - Bone graft spans between transverse processes
- **PLF with instrumentation** (no Interbody fusion)
- **PLIF** (Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion)
    - Laminotomy performed **medial** to facet. (maybe partial fascectomy); does not seek to stabilize the facet joint
    - Access is medial to facet joint
    - Down sides - requires alot of nerve root retraction; risk of dural tears
- **TLIF** (transforaminal)
    - To circumvent extent of neural retraction required
    - Unilateral laminectomy and facetectomy ➔ allows visualisation without excessive retraction
- **XLIF** = Extreme lateral
    - Lateral retroperitoneal ***transpsoas*** corridor
    - Suitable for T12 = L5
        - Not suitable for L5/S1 due to block by iliac crest
    - Lateral position
- **OLIF** = Oblique Lumbar inter body fusion aka Anterior Retroperitoneal Approach
    - Corridor is **anterior to the psoas**
    - Lateral position
- **ALIF** = Anterior Transperitoneal Approach

### Types of Spine Tables

- **Jackson table** ➔ Easy II access, allow lordosis, able to flip patient around for 360 procedures
- **Wilson frame** ➔ “allows treatment of anterior pathology from a posterior approach” by widening the inter-laminar space
- **AMSCO table** ➔ Allow jack-knive position for lateral approach or to further open up interlaminar space in prone position

- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the **Risks** in Anterior and Lateral lumbar spine surgeries?
    - 4 things lying on the psoas
        - **Ureter** - lies on the **psoas** muscle. To know it is the ureter, stroke it and see it peristalsis
        - **Genitofemoral** nerve on the anteromedial surface **psoas** (sensation at upper anterior thigh, scrotum)
        - **Sympathetic chain** on **Medial** border of **psoas** ➔ disruption will lead to warm red foot on ipsilateral side of approach (sympathetics lead to vasoconstriction and disruption leads to vasodilation) ➔ this gives the appearance that the normal foot is cold and pale
        - **Retrograde ejaculation** (superior **hypogastric** plexus - lying anterior to the lower lumbar vertebrae)
    - **Middle sacral artery** must be tied off if not it can become a major bleeder **[begins at L4/5]**

- What is difference between PLIF and TLIF?
    - **PLIF** (Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion)
        - Laminotomy performed **medial** to facet
        - Access is **medial to facet joint**
        - Down sides - requires alot of nerve root retraction; risk of dural tears
    - **TLIF** (transforaminal)
        - To circumvent extent of neural retraction required
        - Unilateral laminectomy and facetectomy ➔ allows visualisation without excessive retraction

- What is the sequence of TLIF?
    - 1. Pedicle **Screw insertion** first.
    - 2. Interbody Space Preparation
        - Distract by pushing spinous processes
        - Carry out unilateral facetectomy
        - Carry out flavectomy
        - Prepare endplates while preserving integrity
        - Insert trial and cage
