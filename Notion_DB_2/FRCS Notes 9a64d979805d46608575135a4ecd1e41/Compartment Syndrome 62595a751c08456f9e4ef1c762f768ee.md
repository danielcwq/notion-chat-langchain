Topic: Trauma

- What is compartment syndrome?
    - Hydrostatic pressure in a closed osteofascial compartment exceeds tissue perfusion pressure
- Role of **prophylactic** compartment release?
    - Arterial repair in ischemic limb.

- What is the diagnostic criteria for Compartment syndrome? Evidence?
    - 2 diagnostic criterias
    - **absolute** compartment pressure **> 30mmHg** or
    - **differential** diastolic - compartment pressure **< 30mmHg.**
    - [McQueen 1996 JBJS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8898137/) paper prospective study of 116 patients compared these 2 criteria - found that using absolute criteria, there would be **40% unncessary fasciotomies**
        - Only 3 patients who met differential pressure criteria underwent op
        - Even though 53 patients had absolute > 30mmHg
        - None had sequelae
        - If absolute criteria used, there would be 40% unnecessary fasciotomies.

## TIBIA

- Where do you insert manometer in the calf?
    - Measure **within 5cm of fracture site**
    - Insert into each compartment
- What are the compartments in the calf?

    - **Anterior** - TA, EHL, EDL,+ ATA, **deep peroneal nerve**
    - **Lateral** - PL, PB + **SPN**
    - **Deep posterior** - TP, FDL, FHL + PTA, **Tibial nerve**
    - **Superficial posterior** - Gastroc, solueus, plantaris + **sural nerve**
- What is the soleus bridge? Implication?
    - Soleus bridge is the fibers of soleus attaching to the medial edge of the tibia
    - “These must be dissected and completely free from and exposing the underside of the tibia to ensure entry into the deep posterior compartment”

- How do you do fasciotomy of calf?
    - Based on BAPRAS guidelines, 2 incision technique
    - **Medial** - 1.5cm posterior to medial border to avoid perforating vessels to skin which are 5, 10, 15cm above the medial malleolus ➔ will strive to preserve them.
    - **Lateral** - 2cm lateral to anterior tibial border

- What if issues with closure?
    - Primary closure with skin grafting on other side.
    - Dermatotraction using a shoelace technique with vessel loops has been described.

## THIGH

- What are the compartments of the thigh?
    - Medial - Adductor Magnus, brevis, longus, **Gracilis** + **deep femoral** NVB
    - Anterior - Sartorius, Quads + **Femoral** NVB
    - Posterior - SM, ST, BF + sciatic nerve

## FOOT

- How many compartments in the foot?
    - Number of compartments ic controversial, with current consensus being **9**
        - 4 interossei compartments
        - Medial Com. (**Abd** Hallucis, **Flexor** hallucis brevis)
        - Lateral com. (**Abductor** digiti quinti, **flexor** digiti quinti)
        - Superficial Comp (Flexor digitorium longus and breves tendons, lumbricals)
        - Adductor Comp (adductor halucis)
        - Calcaneal comp. (Quadrates plantae muscle)

- Should we release foot compartment syndrome?
    - Controversial as surgery has high risk of wound infection and potential for soft tissue coverage. Without surgery, development of contractures such as claw toes and caves foot deformity.
    - [JFAS Han Fucai et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25441288/). Recommend compartment release within **4 hours as timing** was a critical factor for outcomes.
