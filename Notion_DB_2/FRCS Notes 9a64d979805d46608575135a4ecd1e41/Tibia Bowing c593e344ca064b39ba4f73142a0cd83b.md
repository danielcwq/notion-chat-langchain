- Management?
    - Stretching of calcaneovalgus foot
    - Spontaneously resolves over 5-7 years

- What is fibula hemimelia?
    - G = **Sonic hedgehog gene** with abnormality in ZPA axis
    - E = Resulting with short or missing fibula
    - I = No inheritance pattern
- Short case description of Fibula Hemimelia?
    - Shortening (more from tibia), Hypoplasia, absent lateral rays
    - I suspect this is Fibula hemimelia, would like to go on to take further Hx, PE, Invx
- ‼️ ⚠️ What other associated clinical features with fibula hemimelia?
    - **UL** - ulnar club hand with missing ulnar digits (ulna bowing)
    - **Femur** - shortened due to PFFD, Trendlenberg due to Coxa vara
    - **Knee** - laxity (ACL deficiency), patellar instability, **valgus** knee **(LFC hypoplasia ➔ ACL deficient)**
    - **Tibia** - Anteromedial bowing and dimpling
    - **Ankle** - ROM stiff due to ball and socket, tight TA
    - **Foot** - absent lateral rays, pes planus (tarsal coalition ➔ ankle remodels into ball and socket), **equinovalgus** foot (can be severe)
- What Invx you going to do?
    - XR of hip - coxa vara, PFFD
    - XR of knee - patella dislocated, tibia spines under-developed
    - XR of tibia - anteromedial bowing
        
        ![Untitled](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - XR of ankle - ball and socket
        
        ![Untitled](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - XR of foot for tarsal coalition
    - Long film XR with blocks to determine LLD
- ‼️ **Classification of Fibula Hemimelia?**
    - Achterman and Kalamchi = presence of fibula
        - Type 1 = present but hypoplastic fibula
        - Type 2 = completely absent fibula
    - Birch Classifx = foot and LLD
        - **Type 1 = foot reconstructable** (at least 3 rays)
        - Further subdivided in to 4 types based on LLD at the point of diagnosis:
            - 1A = < 6%
            - 1B = 6-10%
            - 1C = 11-30%
            - 1D = >30%
        - **Type 2 = Foot not reconstructable**
- **How will you manage fibula hemimelia?**
    - **Mx is dependant on foot reconstructibility, and LLD**
    - Goals = stable knee, foot and ankle while optimize LLD
    - **Mx guided by Birch classifx -** Principles are contralateral epiphysiodesis +/- ipsilateral lengthening
        - Type 1A = growth **modulation (Epiphysiodesis of longer side)**
        - Type 1 B, C = add on ipsilateral **distraction** osteogenesis
        - Type 1D, **2** = **Amputation** as cannot lengthen more than 30% due to NV compromise
            - **Syme’s** Amputation (trans malleolar amputation with no calcaneum) or **Byod’s** amputation (flip calcaneum)
    - Must remember to excise fibrocartilage **Anlage** that will cause posterolateral tethering
- What kind of amputation do you know at the foot/ ankle?
    - What are the variations of amputations at ankle?

            ![Untitled](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b/Untitled%205.png)
            
        - **Pirigoff** = Talectomy, Distal calcaneum osteotomy; flipped such that the calcaneum tuberosity now faces down NUH Paper: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976534/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976534/)

### AL bowing = Congenital Pseudoarthrosis (#❗️❗️ )

![Untitled](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b/Untitled%209.png)

- What is this?
    - Clinical photo showing anterolateral bowing
    - Concern of Pseudoarthrosis or Tibial hemimelia
    - Triple assessment to evaluate severity and confirm NF
- Congenital Pseudoarthrosis - differential diagnosis?
    - AL bowing, possibly fracture
    - Ddx - infection, tumor
- Pathophysiology of pseudoarthrosis?
    - Etiology not fully understood, associated with NF-1
    - Presence of **fibrous harmatoma** at the pseudoarthrosis site, originating from abnormal periosteal growth
    - Harmatoma restricts blood flow to pseudoarthrosis site and impairs local circulation; also has increased osteoclastic properties.
    - Harmatoma may actually occupy the entire medullary cavity of the tibia, and thus not just a local problem but affect the entire tibia
- Presence of Fibula pseudoathrosis?
    - Original literature suggested that fibula involvement results in poorer prognosis but a multicenter study indicated that patients with fibula involvement achieved successful union more frequently.
- ‼️ Correlation with neurofibromatosis?
    - 10% of NF 1 has AL bowing
    - 50% of AL bowing has NF
- How to classify Pseudoarthrosis?
    - **Crawford** Classification
    
    ![Untitled](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    - Type 1 = bowing
    - 2 = hourglass constriction
    - 3 = cysts
    - 4 = obliterated (penciling)
- What is the fibrous harmatoma?
    - Cells composing the harmatoma not fully characterised
    - Majority of cells in fibrous harmatoma were **fibroblasts lacking a basement membrane** in the stationary phase.

- **Mx of pseudoarthrosis?**
    - [Pre fracture] **< 3 yo** = Bracing in total contact orthosis
        - Brace at all times during weight bearing till skeletal maturity
        - Surgery for Pre-fracture is highly controversial.
        - Avoid osteotomy due to poor leading. Only do if there is a fracture.
        - **If fractures ➔ need surgery**
    - **Surgical** **Reconstruction** can be considered if > 3
        - Goal = resect pseudoarthrosis **fibrous harmatoma**, achieve union, limb length and alignment. Many techniques described
        - Paley’s **Cross-union surgery** involving **4 components:**
            - Aim to achieve cross union between fibula and tibia
        
        ![Untitled](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b/Untitled%2011.png)
        
        - 1. **Excision** of pseudoarthorsis fibrous **harmatoma**, Internal fixation with growing rod and plates,
        - 2. bone **grafting** - between tibia and fibula to achieve cross union
        - 3**. BMP-2**
        - 4. IV **Zolendronic** Acid
        - Eventually may have shortening ➔ may need proximal tibia lengthening
        - Other options - ex fix, free vascularized fibular grafting
    - **Salvage** = Amputation
        - Indications - failure to achieve bony union after 3 surgeries
- **Mx if fracture?**
    - Will NEED surgery as very limited potential of healing
    - Paley’s Cross Union Surgery

### AL Bowing = Tibia Hemiemlia (#❌ )

![Untitled](Tibia%20Bowing%20c593e344ca064b39ba4f73142a0cd83b/Untitled%2013.png)

- What is Tibia Hemimelia?
    - Longitudinal deficiency of tibia with varying degrees of tibia absence
    - **AD** inheritance
    - 30% bilateral
- Associated deformities?
    - UL – ulnar aplasia
    - LL – PFFD, Polydactyly, Equinovarus
- ‼️ Classification of tibia hemimelia?
    - **Jone’s**
    - Type 1 = complete absence of tibia
    - 2 = proximal present only
    - 3 = distal present only
    - 4 = tibia shortened with disastasis of ankle joint
- What will you assess for clinically?
    - Check for knee ligamentous stability and presence of knee extensor mechanism
- **Mx of tibia hememilia?**
    - Dependant on knee stability and extensor mechanism
        - No knee extension = **Disarticulation *thru knee amputation**
        - Active knee extension present = Synostosis of fibula to partial tibia +/- **symes amputation**
