### RC Tear

- What percentage of elderly has asymptomatic RC tear?
    - 40%
- ‼️ ⚠️ How will you classify?
    - Chronicity
    - Size of tear - < 1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm
    - Depth of tear - partial or full thickness
    - Sidednesss if partial
        - **Articular** sided - More common due to poorer blood supply
        - **Bursal** - Consequently, bursal sided partial tear relative indication for op due to better blood supply
    - Based on Extent of retraction = Patte [MRI coronal]
        - Stage 1 = retraction near to incision, does not past head apex
        - 2 = retract to apex of head to glenoid
        - 3 = retract past the level of glenoid

    - Based on Extent of Fatty Infiltration = **Goutalier** [MRI sagittal]
        - Stage 0 = no fat
        - 1 = fatty streak
        - 2 = Less fat than muscle
        - 3 = fat = muscle
        - 4 = more fat than muscle

- What is definition of Massive RC tear?
    - > 5cm or 2 out of 4 tendons is ruptured
- How does a Geyser Sign form?
    
    ![Untitled](Rotator%20Cuff%20Tears%20Arthropathy%20RC%20Issues%20bb1099282d3d4ec29fc688f31027ec35/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - 2 pre-requisites to occur
        - 1. RC full thickness tear so synovial joint can lead into subacromial spaces ➔ high riding of humerus ➔ **mechanical abrasion** of the ACJ
        - 2. ACJ degeneration to form a one way valve
    - Ddx = ganglion cyst, lipoma, tumor, infection
- Management of Geyser Sign?
    - Address underlying etiology - cuff tear or ACJ OA
    - Aspiration not recommended due to high recurrence rate and potential for draining sinus
    - Mumford procedure = distal clavicle excision to address one way valve
- What is pseudoparalysis?
    - Inability to actively flex and abduct shoulder >90, but has full PROM, and intact neurology, no pain
    - Some authors comment only if injection of LA
- What is the management of RC tear?
    - Decision is based on Patient and Injury factors
    - **Patient** - age, function
    - **Injury** - chronicity (acute better), extent of fat, retraction, presence of OA?
    - Young, No OA, acute, reparable = repair
    - Young, No OA, non reparable = SCR/ tendon transfers
    - OA = replace
- ‼️  ⚠️ Difference between open vs Arthroscopic?
    - [UKUFF Trial RCT 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28053265/) of 273 patients found
        - **no difference** in outcomes of open vs arthroscopy with
        - rates of re-tear similar (35-45%) assessed by MRI or US at 12 months.
- Single row vs Double row technique?
    - [Wall 2009 et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19833290/) Biomechanical study review found DR better biomechanics properties than SR likely due to Lateral row increase surface area of foot print
    - [Chen et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23711754/) Meta-analysis in Arthroscopy - DR repair provides higher rates of healing but does not translate to better clinical outcomes
- What tendon transfers and to restore what movement?
    - Internal rotation - Pec Major OR **Lat Dorsi** (newer technique)
    - External Rotation - **Lat Dorsi** OR **Lower trapezius** (new) for ER
- ⚠️ What is Superior Capsular Reconstruction?
    - **Mihata** et al. described with fascia lata autograft or dermal allograft to reconstruct the superior capsule, attaching the graft to the **infraspinatus** posteriorly and **Subscapularis** anteriorly and to the **GT** laterally
    - Subsequently Hirahara and Burkhart popularised the technique in the western world using extracellular matrix patches
- Why cannot do TSA for cuff tear?
    - In the Superior- inferior direction - In cuff-deficient patients, the unopposed action of the deltoid causes superior migration of the humeral head (mobile COR), leading to poor functional results, glenoid component loosening, and early surgical failures.
    - **No fixed fulcrum**
    - In the AP direction, **Rocking horse phenomenon** ➔ loosening

### Rotator Cuff Arthropathy

- Why does humeral head migrates superiorly in presence of massive tear?
    - RC normally functions to apply concentric force to head on glenoid, acting as a **force couple** together with the deltoid
    - When there is tear, force couple is disrupted with the uninterrupted action of the deltoid moving it proximally
    - Secondly, potential space is created when SS tears and retracts, allowing Deltoid to elevate the humeral head
    - Other muscles that cross the shoulder joint also pulls it up - coracobrachialis
- Why is the patient unable to initiate abduction?
    1. Supraspinatus not present as the initiator of abduction
    2. Because deltoid muscle is now shortened, inefficient as per the length tension curve
- Clinical assessment
    - History
    - PE - DELTOID function, axillary nerve
    - Need to check for Teres Minor Function - horn blower sign.
- Other than RC tear, what can cause superior migration of humerus?
    - ?neurologic cause
- How do you classify Rotator cuff arthropathy?
    - **Hamada** Classifx, looking at the acromiohumeral index and presence of OA
        
        ![Untitled](Rotator%20Cuff%20Tears%20Arthropathy%20RC%20Issues%20bb1099282d3d4ec29fc688f31027ec35/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - **1** > 6mm,
    - **2** < 6mm,
    - **3** acetabularisation,
    - **4** = glenohumeral space narrowing,
    - **5** humeral head **Collapse**
- What is CLEER?
    - Stands for **C**ombined **L**oss of **A**ctive **E**levation and **E**xternal Rotation
    - Seen in up to 10% of patients with Rotator Cuff Arthropathy
    - Will require a Lat Dorsi transfer
- Why must you restore external rotation? How?
    - RTSA does not restore ER
    - If no ER, patient can flex but unable to external rotate - cannot eat with elbow down. Need to eat in horn blower position
    - Restore with Lat Dorsi transfer.
- Pre Op invx?
    - ENSURE deltoids are working! Check Lat Dorsi for bonus
    - CT scan to evaluate bone stock
- How do you do RTSA?
    - Approach – deltopectoral approach
    - Technique
        - Expose joint ➔ humerus cut
        - Glenoid prep – good **inferior translation and angulation** 15
        - Humerus prep – **retroversion 25-40 deg** from transepicondyle axis
- ‼️ How does the RTSA work?
    - Principle – inverses relationship of humeral head and glenoid
    - Allows deltoid to replace the function of the Supraspinatus in arm abduction by:
    - 1. **Medialize** COR to increase moment arm of deltoid
    - 2. **Inferiorize** humerus to increase deltoid length-muscle tension
    - 3. **Fix** the COR of the deltoid to glenoid (as opposed to it being mobile on the humeral head
- Complications of RTSA
    - **Scapular notching** – avoid by inferiorize and inferior angulation of base plate
        - Siveraux classifx - based in involvement of inferior screw and central peg
            
            ![Untitled](Rotator%20Cuff%20Tears%20Arthropathy%20RC%20Issues%20bb1099282d3d4ec29fc688f31027ec35/Untitled%205.png)
            
    - **Dislocation**
        - Mostly anterior
        - **Subscap repair** reduces rate of dislocation
        - Salvage – revision/ CTA head
    - **Infection risk** higher than TSA due to more dead space
- What is the controversy with subscap repair in RTSA?
    - Controversial with no clear consensus. Both are safe and successful
    - (+) Increased stability
    - (-) RTSA converts SS to a functional adductor and internal rotator and potentially limits external rotation.

### Calcific Tendonitis

- What is it?
    - Unknown etiology characterised by build up of **calcium hydroxyapatite** crystals within tendons which then undergo spontaneous resorption with subsequent healing of tendon
- What are the causes of calcification around the shoulder joint?
    - **Metabolic** - Pseudogout (chondrocalcinois), Calcific tendonitis, Milwaukee Shoulder, Renal failure (**Tumoral Calcinosis)**
    - **Tumor** -
        - Benign - synovial chondromatosis,
        - Malignant - Chondrosarcoma
    - **Ectopic** Ossifications - MO or HO
- What stages? (3)
    - **1. Pre-calcific stage**
    - **2. Calcific** stage with 3 sub stage
        - *Formative* - calcium deposition
        - *Resting -* lacks inflammation
        - *Resorptive* - more heterogenous.
            - **Pain** is worse in the resorptive phase (increased inflammation and vascular ingrowth)
    - **3. Post Calcific** granulation tissue with remodelling
- ‼️ What is the classification of calcific tendonitis?
    - **Gartner and Heyer** Classification
        - 1 = well circumscribed, dense, calcification
        - 2 = soft contour
        - 3 = Translucent cloudy appearance

- Mx of calcific tendonitis?
    - Supportive analgesia
    - Needle Barbotage under US (indicated in resorptive phase)
        - Why need 2 needles?

### SS/IS Wasting

- What nerves affected?
    - Suprascapular nerve arises from brachial plexus Superior trunk ➔ Suprascapular notch (under transverse scapula ligament) ➔ Supraglenoid notch
    
    ![Untitled](Rotator%20Cuff%20Tears%20Arthropathy%20RC%20Issues%20bb1099282d3d4ec29fc688f31027ec35/Untitled%207.png)
