- What is stress?
    - Force applied per unit area (N/m2)
- What is strain?
    - Change in length / original length (no units)
- What is isotropy?
    - **Isotropic** = material behaves identically (uniform properties) irrespective of applied force e.g. most orthopaedic materials
    - **Anisotropy** = Behaviour is dependant on direction of the force (all living tissue e.g. BONE)
- What is Hooke's Law?
    - There is a **linear relationship between stress and strai**n in the elastic zone
    - This gives rise to your Young Modulus.
- What is the Young's Modulus of Elasticity?
    - **Measure of stiffness** (ability to withstand deformation) in the elastic zone (N/m2)
    - It is a demonstration of Hooke's law which states that...
- ‼️ DRAW stress strain curve?

    - **Elastic** = recoverable. Molecular **bonds** are **stretched but not broken**
    - **Yield point**
        - “Confluence of 3 points”  = Proportional limit, elastic limit, yield stress
        - yield stress = elastic limits = limit of proportionality (for ortho purposes, very close to one another) = molecular **bonds** are broken

    - **Plastic** = not recoverable. Has 3 zones
    - **1. Yielding** = increase length with no increase in stress
    - **2. Strain hardening aka cold working** phase where plastic deformation increases a material's resistance to further deformation by disrupting the lattice structure - due to changes in crystalline structure [cold working] “traffic jams in the lattice structure”

        - Lattice defects occurring in the material become too much in number and they restrict each other’s movement. Essentially traffic jams have been created that obstruct movement of lattice defects.
    - **Ultimate tensile strength =** strain hardening into necking
    - **3. Necking** - plastic deformation leads to acute reduction in stress due reduction of cross sectional area of the material
    - **Fracture stress**
- What are the practical use of cold working?
    - Cold working is bringing the material to a stress more than yield point but not to UTS
    - The stiffness of material increases due to disription of the lattice structure
    - Most orthopaedic implants are cold worked
    - **EXCEPT recon plates** that are supposed to be more malleable to shape around bony prominences!
- What are the units for stress strain curve?
    - N/m2
    - Stress is N/m2
    - Strain is no units
- Compare stress strain curves for different materials?

    - 10 materials - with estimated values.
- Can you draw comparative curves for a brittle, strong, ductile and plastic material?

- Draw comparative curves for cancellous vs cortical bone?
    
    ![Untitled](17%20Biomaterial%20Behaviour%2019842c5e9801457b862e5b8acb6c4c8c/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - Cancellous bone is less stiff, less gradient (young Modulus)
    - Lower Yield point
    - Prolonged plastic phase - due to collapse of trabeculae until marrow space is filled before stiffness increases again
- ‼️ What are the **terms** used to describe metals and their definitions?
    - **Ductile vs Brittle**
        - Ductile = undergo large amount of plastic deformation
        - Brittle = display elastic behaviour right up to failure (no plastic deformation) e.g. ceramics.
    - **Strength** - “Strong vs Weak”
        - Referring to the Ultimate tensile strength
    - **Stiff (material property) vs Flexible/ Elastic**
        - Refers to the stress-strain curve. The steeper it is, the higher the young Module, the stiffer the material
    - **Toughness**
        - Refers to area under curve
        - Tough = large area = able to absorb a lot of energy before failing
        - Unit is **Energy (Joules)**
    - **Hardness (scratch profile)**
        - Surface property of material - ability to resist scratching
        - Not on stress strain curve
        - Material that is harder (aka better scratch profle) does not cause ridges upon scratching, thus less wear

    - **Notch sensitivity**
        - Sensitivity of material to fracture by presence of surface inhomogeneity
        - In **brittle** materials a crack grows to a critical size from which it propagates right through the structure in a fast manner, whereas with a **ductile** material the crack keeps getting bigger until the remaining area cannot support the load and a ductile failure occurs.
        - A notch causes non uniform stress flow lines.
    - **Rigidity (structural property - depends on length, thickness...)**
        - Ability for the structure to withstand deformation
- Viscoelasticity Properties?
    - "Velocity-dependant response"

    - Creep = same stress (Force/area), strain (length) increases
        
        ![Untitled](17%20Biomaterial%20Behaviour%2019842c5e9801457b862e5b8acb6c4c8c/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - Stress Relaxation = same strain (length), ￼ stress decreases

    - Hysteresis = energy lost as heat (due to **internal friction)**

- What clinical examples of Viscoelastic properties?
    - **Ponsetti** casting - example of creep when ligaments slowly stretch out under the constant force of the rigid cast
    - **Broaching** of femur - example of stress relaxation when the constant displacement of the broach in the femur, wait a few moments before malleting to allow stress relaxation before continuing
- What is hoop stress?
    - It is stress generated in the perpendicular direction to axis of the item
    - E.g. Meniscus - hoop stresses generated when knee axially loaded
    - E.g. Stem inserted into medullary cavity converted to circumfrential hoop stress
- ‼️ What are the 3 ways materials can fail?
    - **Brittle** Failure - stress is > UTS; at a **SINGLE LOAD**
    - **Creep** Failure aka necking - stress at **CONSTANT load WITH TIME**
    - **Fatigue** failure - failure at **REPEATED LOADS**
