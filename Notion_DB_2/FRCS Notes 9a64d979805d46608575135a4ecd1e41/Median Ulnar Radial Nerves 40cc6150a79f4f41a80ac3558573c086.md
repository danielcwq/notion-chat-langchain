# Median nerve

- ‼️ What is the anatomy of the Median nerve?
    - Medial + Lateral cord of BP ➔ Runs **Lateral** to Brachial Artery in the arm ➔ **Goes medial** to brachial artery in cubital fossa ➔ 2 heads of Pronator teres ➔ AIN branches out ➔ Travels between **FDS and FDP**
    - Median nerve proper ➔ PCBMN 5cm from wrist ➔ enters the Carpal tunnel, supplies LOAF muscles and sensation of radial 3.5 fingers. (OAF muscles by the recurrent motor branch
- What muscles does AIN supply?
    - FDP, FPL and PQ

- ‼️ What are the variations of recurrent motor branch? Implication?
    - 3 main types
    - **Extra-lig** (most common 50%) - arises distal to TCL)
    - **Sub-ligament** (30%) - arises within TCL, then travels out
    - **Trans-ligament** (20%) - pierces the TCL
    - Arises from ulnar branch.
    - Lying on top of the TCL
    - **implication**: Cut TCL far ulnar

    - **Martin Gruber** [connection in forearm] - as high as **27%** prevalence! [MOTOR only]
        - median nerve ➔ ulnar nerve distally
            
            ![Untitled](Median%20Ulnar%20Radial%20Nerves%2040cc6150a79f4f41a80ac3558573c086/Untitled%203.png)
            
        - Can be bidirectional
        - For example in, carpal tunnel syndrome, there may be partial or total sparing of thenar muscles
        - Conversely, a patient with compression of ulnar nerve at cubital tunnel syndrome may present with symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, but show negative findings with regard to Tinel and Phalen tests.
    - **Marinacci** (aka reverse Martin Gruber; in forearm) - rare 0.7%
        - ulnar nerve ➔ median nerve
            
            ![Untitled](Median%20Ulnar%20Radial%20Nerves%2040cc6150a79f4f41a80ac3558573c086/Untitled%204.png)

    - **Berrettini** as high as 60%
        - Connection between common digital nerves of ulnar and median nerves; commonly between 4th and 3rd finger
- Which intrinsic muscle is SOLELY supplied by the median nerve?
    - Prof Kumar always say it is APB
    - But study by Uncini et al. 1988 has found "dual innervation of the APB by median and ulnar fibers via a marin-gruber anastamosis"
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3215751/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3215751/)
- How are 3 tests to differentiate CTS and AIN palsy?

    - Initial on and off paraesthesia - Normal NCS
    - **Demyelination** ➔ Increased latency, normal amplitude
    - **Axonal degeneration** ➔ decreased amplitude

## CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

- When do you do NCS EMG for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?
    - CTS Should be a clinical diagnosis
    - However, can do if symptoms are not typical/ concern on double crush
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the effectiveness of steroids injection for Carpal Tunnel?
    - Based on the **LANCET INSTINCTS [INjection versus SplinTing in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]** Trial, RCT of 234 patients. injection vs night resting splint for 6 weeks.
    - Significantly better Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionaire at 6 weeks BUT **no difference at 6 months.**

- What are the boundaries of the Carpal Tunnel and contents?
    - Boundaries of CT:
        - Roof – **Transverse Carpal Ligament**,
        - Floor – Prox Carpal row
        - Ulnar - Hook of hamate/ Pisiform
        - Radial - Scaphoid tubercle/ trapezium.

    - I – along radial border of RF - to avoid too radial that will affect recurrent motor nerve, too ; too ulnar will affect ulnar nerve in guyon canal
    - **Kaplan line** = ulnar border of abducted thumb (Corresponds to Superficial palmar arch (so do not go distal to it)
    - D – Skin, subcut, palmar aponeurosis ➔ TCL
- What does the kaplan line correspond to?
    - Kaplan line has been described in literature to surface mark several structures, most commonly superficial palmar arch, which is 1cm distal from the Kaplan line.
        
        ![Untitled](Median%20Ulnar%20Radial%20Nerves%2040cc6150a79f4f41a80ac3558573c086/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Arguably, the most vulnerable structure during CTR is the SPA, the distal extent of the ulnar artery.

- ‼️ ⚠️ Difference between Endoscopic vs Open?
    - **Cochrane reviews 2014** found similar effectiveness between both techniques
    - Endoscopic advantages are
        - better grip strength,
        - faster Return to work (8 days)
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24482073/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24482073/)

    - Pain due to widening of the carpal arch
    - Reported 6-36% incidence
- ‼️ **Tendon transfers** for median nerve?
    - Goal in Chronic CTS: Restore Thumb Abduction
    - Goal in high median nerve = Restore thumb abduction, thumb flexion and and finger flexion [high])
    - Thumb abduction “Opponensplasty” =
        - Camitz **PL** to APB (not possible if high median nerve),
        - Huber Adductor Minimi to APB (Lai JM say only done in paeds. do not mention in adults)
        - **EIP** to APB if high median nerve palsy

# Ulnar Nerve

- What is the path of the Ulnar nerve?
    - Medial cord ➔ **medial** to brachial artery ➔ 8cm from ME passes posteriorly thru muscular septum ➔ cubital tunnel (osborne fascia, ME,  ➔ 2 heads of FCU ➔ travels **between FCU and FDP** ➔ DBUN 5cm proximal to wrist ➔ Guyon Canal
- Can you explain the ulnar paradox?
    - Paradox is that a low lesion appears to have a worse deformity
    - Reason is because in a low lesion, the FDP of the 4/5 fingers are still being innervated by the ulnar nerve proximally
    - In a high lesion, the FDP is also paralysed, thus, the
- Clinical Signs/ tests of Ulnar nerve Palsy?
    - Interossei **wasting** of entire hand - seen from dorsum
        
        ![Untitled](Median%20Ulnar%20Radial%20Nerves%2040cc6150a79f4f41a80ac3558573c086/Untitled%2012.png)

    - Mannerfelt sign
        - Described by Mannerfelt in 1966 - Hyperflexion of the PIPJ
        - This is due to the loss of MCPJ flexion in view of weak intrinsics ➔ Flexion is then compensated by the PIPJ
- How do you differentiate high or Low ulnar nerve?
    - **3 tests (same as median nerve 3 tests)**
    - **Sensation** - DBUN
    - **Power** - FDP
    - Ulnar Paradox, provocations at cubital tunnel/ guyon canal
- ‼️ Any classification for ulnar nerve palsy?
    - **McGowan** Classification
        - Stage 1 = purely **subjective** symptoms
        - Stage 2 = **objective** motor and sensory symptoms
            - 2a = no atrophy
            - 2b = some atrophy
        - Stage 3 = **significant** and noticeable **atrophy**

    - [https://meeting.handsurgery.org/abstracts/2020/HSEP300.cgi](https://meeting.handsurgery.org/abstracts/2020/HSEP300.cgi)
    - **APB and Opponens** is 100% median nerve, no cross innervation.
    - **FPB** - median nerve only 73%; ulnar nerve 2%; Dual innervation 25%
    - **Adductor pollicis** - 88% ulnar nerve
- What are the tips and tricks in cubital tunnel release?
    - Be careful of MABC nerve, running next to basilic vein in the approach

    - Zone 3 = **Sensory** branch only
        
        ![Untitled](Median%20Ulnar%20Radial%20Nerves%2040cc6150a79f4f41a80ac3558573c086/Untitled%2020.png)
        
    - However, there is alot of variability
        - “The UN in Guyon’s canal has been found to have a significant variance in its anatomy. The most common variation is the UN branching into a deep and superficial branch within Guyon’s canal.”
        - “These variants can also alter the typical three-zone division of Guyon’s canal and the symptoms associated with each zone.”

- ‼️ What is the **Bouvier test** for claw/ intrinsic minus hand?
    - Bouvier test is an **active** test to evaluate the **integrity of the extensor mechanism** in a claw hand. it can then be classified into "simple" or "complex"
    - When passive correction of the MCP hyperextension allows the patient to extend the interphalangeal joints with the integrity of the extensor mechanism (Positive Bouvier´s test), the claw deformity is classified as a **simple claw hand**.
    - When the patient cannot actively extend the proximal interphalangeal joints after passive MCP hyperextension correction, extensor mechanism impairment exists (Negative Bouvier´s test), and deformity is classified as a **complex** claw hand.
