- Embryology - 3 pathways?
    - Limb growth controlled in 3 axes by **3 different pathways**
        - **AER** (Apical Ectodermal Ridge) [Fibroblast Growth Factors gene] - Proximodistal
        - **ZPA** (Zone of Polarising Activity) [Sonic hedgehog gene] - Radioulna
            - Hox Gene coding for Sonic Hedgehog protein
            - e.g. Radial Club hand defect, fibula hemimelia, Thumb duplication
        - **WnT** (Wingless Type) [LMX1 gene] - dorsoventral
- Draw a limb bud?
    - Limb bud forms at **4 weeks** -->  **complete at 8 weeks**
    - Arises from the Mesoderm with ectoderm overlying it ➔ Somites grow into a limb bud
    - Eventually
        - **Mesoderm** grows into muscle, bone, tendon, cartilage
        - **Ectoderm** grows into overlying skin
    - Draw and talk about the 3 axes of growth
        - AER, ZPA, and the other plane is WnT

- ‼️ Classification of hand deformities?
    - **Swanson** (now is outdated)
    - Group 1 = failure of **formation -** Radial club hand, hypoplastic thumb, ulnar club hand
    - 2 = **Differentiation** Syndactyly, Symbrachydactyly, Radioulnar Synostosis (#❗️ ); Clinodactyly(#❌ )/ Kirner's Deformity (#❌ )/ Camptodactyly (#❌ ); Congenital Clasped Thumb (#❌ , Trigger Thumb [2/10] (#❗️❗️ )
    - 3 = **Duplication** - Thumb duplication
    - 4 = **overgrowth**
    - 5 = **undergrowth**
    - 6 = [C](https://workflowy.com/#/e468024f1791)onstriction Ring syndromes
    - 7 – **generalized** abnormalities
- Bone formation - **3 types?**
    - **Intra-membranous ossification** = mesenchymal tissue transforms directly into bone (clavicle, flat bones)
        - Clinically also seen in distraction osteogenesis
    - **Endochondral ossification** = begins with chondroblasts producing cartilaginous analge which is resorbed and replace with bone
    - **Appositional growth** = increases **width** of bone with osteoblasts being laid down under the periosteum
- Draw the Layers of the Physis?
    - **Physis zones**–**RPH(MDC)+M(PS)**

    - **Resting** Zone = **Germinal** cells, low oxygen tension
    - **Proliferation =** Chondrocytes proliferate, high oxygen tension
    - **Hypertrophic** Zone (3 subzones)
        - Maturation - 5 fold increase in size, accumulate calcium
        - Death - during "cell mediated apoptosis", Calcium is released
        - Provisional Calcification zone
    - **Metaphysis**
        - Cartilage removed and bone is laid down by **osteoblasts**
        - Remodelled into lamellar bone to produce secondary spongiosa

- What is the pink stain?
    - **Safranin O** staining the cartilage (same stain used for gram stain couterstain)
- Why does the physis grow longitudinally?
    - Due to constraint provided by perichondrial ring of LaCroix (fibrous osseous structure that provides a strong supporting girdle around the periphery of the physis) , the growth becomes longitudinal and not horizontal
- ‼️ What is the blood supply of the physis?
    - 3 main blood supply -
        - **Epiphyseal** artery - supplies secondary ossification center
        - **Metaphyseal** artery (from the nutrient artery of diaphysis)
        - **Perichondral** artery - supplies the ring of LaCroix and anastamoses with Epiphyseal and metaphyseal arteries

- ‼️ What are the 2 directions of bone growth?
    - **Longitudinal** bone growth occurs by enchondral ossification at the physis due to the constraint provided by the perichondrial ring of LaCroix
    - **Appositional** ossification in the osteogenic layer of the periosteum  (inner cambium) is responsible for diaphyseal widening.
- Factors affecting Physis
    - Hormones
        - PTH - Direct mitogenic effect on chondrocytes to proliferate
        - Calcitonin - accelerates calcification
        - Thyroxine - increases DNA synthesis, increase proliferation
        - Growth hormone - increases cellular proliferation
        - Sex hormones - stimulates closure of physis
        - Steroids - reduces cell proliferation
    - Nutrition
        - Vit D - affects provisional calcification ➔ Rickets
        - Vit C - lack of leads to defect in primary spongiosa ➔ Scurvy
        - Growth factors - FGF, TGF-Beta
    - Growth factors
        - Insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factors (FGFR-3 defect in achondroplasia)
- ‼️ Diseases affecting physis (divide by zone)?
    - Reserve zone - **Gaucher’s**, **Disatrophic** Dysplasia (affects cartilage - cauliflower ears)
    - **Proliferative** zone - **Achondroplasia**, gigantism, **Multiple Hereditary exostosis (MHE)**
    - **Hypertrophic** zone - Rickets, Salter Harris, SCFE (Zone of PC )
    - Primary spongiosa - **Scurvy** (Vit C deficiency)
    - Secondary Spongiosa - Renal osteodystrophy, **OI**
- Where are the physes in the hand, Metacarpals and phalanges?

    - Proximal ends of the phalanges and distal ends of the metacarpals
