- What is the difference between tendon and ligaments?
    - THink as Tendons must be stiff for better force transfer, ligaments must be more elastic
    - So ligaments has higher Elastin, More wavy (so higher crimp).
    - Arrangement, Attachment, Blood supply and Contents **(AABC)**
        - A = ligaments less parallel fibres (so has longer toe region)
        - A = Ligaments Bone to bone (joint stability), tendons to transfer muscle tension to induce movement
        - B = blood supply - ligaments directly from insertion site; tendons depend on sheathed vs paratenon
        - C = ligaments higher elastin
- DRAW collagen
    - 3 polypeptide chains of 2 alpha1 and 1 alpha2 right handed triple helix [TROPOCOLLAGEN] ➔ arranged in **quarter staggered array** (microfibrils), held by **cross linking** ➔ fibres
- How is collagen synthesized?
    - 5 steps
    - 1. Synthesis of mRNA from DNA via transcription
    - 2. mRNA then translated into protein polypeptic chains
    - 3. 2 Alpha 1 and 1 alpha2 chains form a right handed triple helix = tropogollagen
    - 4. Arranged in quarter staggered array (microfibrils), held by **cross linking**
    - 5. Multiple microfibrils form fibres
- Why is ligamentum flavum yellow?
    - Rich in elastin - 75% elastin as opposed to other ligaments
- Layers of the tendon?
    - Endotenon ➔ Epitenon ➔ paratenon OR synovial sheath
    - Paratenon tendons = achilles
    - Synovial sheath tendons = finger flexors (sig. blood supply)

- What are the 2 types in ligament or tendon **insertion**?
    - As per Ramachandran:
    - **Direct** = fibrous insertion e.g. **MCL**, **deltoid** tendon
    - **Indirect** = Fibrocartilaginous via 4 zones e.g. **ACL**, **patellar** tendon (Chin tat, Ramachandran)
        
        ![Untitled](8%20Ligaments%20and%20Tendons%20e62211c51dd841d6acbe99a084389a3e/Untitled%201.png)
        
        - Zone 1 = parallel collagen
        - 2 = Collagen intermesh with **unmineralized** fibrocartilage
        - 3 = **mineralized**
        - 4 = merges into **cortical** bone
        - Perforation fibres of sharpey crosses all 4 zones
- What are the stages of tendon healing? When is it weakest?
    - 1. **Inflammatory** – blood clot (Weakest 2/52)
    - 2. **Proliferative** - **type 3** collagen first
    - 3. **Remodelling** – type 3 to type 1
    - Weakest in inflammatory phase 2 week
    - Maximum strength 6 months
- ‼️ Blood supply of tendons and how they affect healing and implications?
    - **Sheathed** = **avascular** tendons = vinculum (mesotenon) that carries vessel
    - **Paratenon** = small arterioles from adjacent muscle (achilles tendon, patellar tendon)
    - Whether sheathed or paratenon will determine **where fibroblasts come from in healing**
        - Extrinsic (in **sheathed** tendon, fibroblasts from tendon **sheath**) ➔ more scar, adhesions
        - Intrinsic (in **paratenon** tendons; fibroblasts directly from **tendon** ➔ better healing
- What factors affect tendon healing?
    - **Patient** factors - biological DM, immunosupression, infectin
    - **Surgeon** factors - calbire of suture, number of core, epitendinous)
    - **Injury** factors - joint stability, immobilization, is it intra-articular (e.g. ACL)
- DRAW stress strain curve of ligaments and tendons
    - Toe region, linear region
    - **Plin** = Linear Yield point
        - Dips (sequential failure) as some fibers fail
    - Stress can still increase to **Pmax = UTS** as there are some fibers that can continue to withstand stress

- What are the Viscoelasticity Properties? Draw and give clinical examples?
    - "Velocity-dependant response"
        
        ![Untitled](8%20Ligaments%20and%20Tendons%20e62211c51dd841d6acbe99a084389a3e/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Creep = same stress (Force/area), strain (length) increases (e.g. ACL pre tensioning, Ponsetti Casting)
        
        ![Untitled](8%20Ligaments%20and%20Tendons%20e62211c51dd841d6acbe99a084389a3e/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Stress Relaxation = same strain (length), ￼ stress decreases (e.g. when broaching, we wait for stress relaxation before malleting)
        
        ![Untitled](8%20Ligaments%20and%20Tendons%20e62211c51dd841d6acbe99a084389a3e/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - Hysteresis = energy lost as heat
