### Ankle Fractures

- What is **Bosworth** Fracture?
    - It is a rare fracture of distal fibula with associated fixed posterior dislocation of **proximal** fibular fragment which becomes entrapped behind the **posterior tibia tubercle**

- What is a **maisonneuve** Fracture? [Always take tibia XR]
    - Spiral fracture of the proximal third of the fibula with distal syndesmosis disruption
    - Usually a Pronation-external rotation injury
- What is the classification of ankle fractures?
    - **Lauge Hansen Classification**
    - **First look at the fibula** for the hint on the type -
        - Simple Weber A = SAD
            
            ![Untitled](Ankle%20Fractures%206a6f6accffe947108ca721a548dbbf27/Untitled%201.png)
            
        - Simple Weber B = SER
        - Simple Weber C/ maisoneuve = PER
        - Comminuted fibula = PAB (fails in compression)
            
            ![Untitled](Ankle%20Fractures%206a6f6accffe947108ca721a548dbbf27/Untitled%202.png)
            
    - **Secondly, know the sequence** of events for each type
        - **SER** (85%) – AITFL ➔ Weber B LM ➔ PM ➔ MM (oblique)

        - **SAD** – Weber A LM ➔ MM (vertical)

        - **PER** – MM (short transverse) ➔ AITFL ➔ Weber C LM ➔ PM
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-08-12 at 1.22.22 PM.png](Ankle%20Fractures%206a6f6accffe947108ca721a548dbbf27/Screenshot_2022-08-12_at_1.22.22_PM.png)

        - **PAB** – MM (Short transverse) ➔ AITFL ➔ Weber C comminuted LM

- ‼️Do we need to fix the posterior malleolus? What classification?
    - Previous reccomendation was to fix based on size > 25% however, this has fallen out of favour
    - Instead, we use the Mason and malloy classification to decide
    - Type 1 = avulsion only ➔ Syndesmotic fixation
    - Type 2 = Volkmann fragment **involving incisuria** ➔ PL approach to fix
    - Type 3 = Coronal fracture line ➔ PM approach to fix
    - **Cf. Haraguchi classification**
        - type 1 = MM type 2
        - Type 2 = medial extension = MM type 3
        - Type 3 = shell type = MM type 1
- What is your acute management of ankle fractures?
    - Span, Scan Plan
- Definitive management of ankle fractures?
    - PL approach. **Fix PM** ➔ ligamentotaxis ➔ reduce fibula (PA screw/ plate)
    - **Fix fibular** (lag screw + neut/ antiglide)
    - **Fix MM** – cancellous screw/ hook plate/ Tension band
    - Other considerations
- How will you fix differently if there is **DM neuropathy**?
    - DM neuropathy ➔ Use of supplemental fixation consisting of multiple syndesmotic screws, transarticular fixation, supplemental Ex fix, prolonged NWB
    - “Superconstruct principles by [Sammarco et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19712882/)”
        - **3 principles**
            - extension of fusion **beyond zone of injury**
            - include joints not affected;
            - adequate bone resection to improve soft tissue envelope ; minimal soft tissue dissection
        - **3 fixation techniques**
            - 1 plantar plates,
            - 2 multiple locked plates,
            - 3 axial screw fixation
- How do you manage **isolated Weber B lateral malleolus** fractures?
    - Assess stability – gravity stress views to assess if medial clear space opens up
    - Stable ➔ Cast/ air cast boot
    - Unstable ➔ Fix

### SYNDESMOSIS INJURY

- What are the ankle syndesmosis Ligaments?
    - AITFL, PITFL, ITL (inferior transverse ligament posteriorly) IOL, Accessory Anterior inferior Tibiofibular ligament (Accessory AITFL) aka Bassett's ligament

- Parameters in syndesmosis injury?
    
    ![Untitled](Ankle%20Fractures%206a6f6accffe947108ca721a548dbbf27/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - 1. Medial clear space - normal ~4mm
        
        ![Untitled](Ankle%20Fractures%206a6f6accffe947108ca721a548dbbf27/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - 2. Tibiofibular overlap - normal > 1mm on mortise view
    - 3. Tibiofibular clear space - 1cm above talus normal < 5mm

- How do you assess the syndesmosis intra-op?
    - Cotton's test
    - Lateral rotation stress test
- ‼️ How do you put the syndesmotic screw?
    - Direction: 30 ° from posterior to anterior, parallel to tibia plafond, **2-4cm above the joint**
    - Ankle position: Neutral position. Previously thought to do it in dorsiflexion
    - Screw size - 3.5mm or 4.5mm no difference
    - Number of cortices - quad cortical vs tricortical no difference
    - Be careful with over-reduction
- Difference between tight rope vs screw?
    - No difference in functional outcomes
    - Tight rope reduced reop rates and malreduction
- Do we need to hold foot in dorsiflexion?
    - Previously thought that if tightened in with ankle in dorsiflexion, the widest portion of the talus will be engaged, thus preventing overtightening and thus preventing reduced ROM.
    - Recent cadaveric studies did not find the need to maximally dorsiflex the ankle in order to prevent loss of motion
- Do we need to remove screws?
    - No consensus on the necessity or the timing
    - Some advocate routine removal 6 weeks to 4 months post op
    - Theorized to reduce discomfort and to allow physiologic movement at ankle, prevent screw breakage
    - Some studies found removal not beneficial, no difference in pain, ROM or function even if broken.
