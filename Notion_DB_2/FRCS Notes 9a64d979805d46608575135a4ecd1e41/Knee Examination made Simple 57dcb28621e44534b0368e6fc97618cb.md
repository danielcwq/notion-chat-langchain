# Knee Exam made Simple

### Stand

- Front
    - Put feet together to look for alignment
    - mention intermalleolar distance
    - squinting patellae
    - Scars
- Side view - look for recurvatum
- Valgus knee - comment if associated planovalgus foot

### Walk

- Valgus/ Varus thrust
- Stiff knee gait with vaulting (fused knee)
- Foot progression angle

### Sit with legs dangling

- Flex and extend knee repeatedly one side each, looking for J-sign
- Also assess for crepitus when swinging leg up and down

### Lie down, Knee extended

- Look for scars
- Temperature
- Effusion - 3 tests - Bulge, ballotment and patella tap
- Palpate patella - medial and lateral facets,
- apprehension - push patella laterally and flex

### Check ROM

- Start with self Straight leg raise
    - If patient unable to fully extend, help to correct the flexion
    - if correctible = “extensor lag”
    - if not correctible = “fixed flexion”
- Flexion, then check Hips IR and ER when fully flexed to screen hips

### Knees at 90 degrees

- Look first - for posterior lag - comment
- Sit on the leg
- Feel for loss of posterior step - compare
- “Before I continue to assess the ligaments, I will palpate the knee”
- Palpate extensor mechanism and joint line

### Continue with Ligaments

- PCL tests x 4
    - 1. Lost of step
    - 2. Posterior drawer
    - 3. Quadriceps active test [Omit]
    - 4. Pen Test [Omit]
- ACL test - ADT
- Extend leg now
- Lachman - 10-15 deg
- MCL, LCL tests at 0 and 30 ° (to defunction the joint capsule)

### Complete with checking neurovascular - foot drop and DP, PT

- Plus Beighton score - consider LET

# Common Short Cases and Extra Steps

- ➔ If Chronic PCL, Chronic ACL, Multi-ligament Injury
    - External recurvatum Test
    - Prone - Dial test
    - Emphasize CPN if multiligamentous injury - 25-50% incidence
    - Beighton score (higher risk of graft failure)
- ➔ If patella instability
    - **Look at finger nails 💅**  - “no dysmorphic nails”
    - Evaluate size of patella “Patella size does not appear deficient’
    - Assessing rotational profile (4 components)
        - Check for increased Femoral anteversion
            - Prone position, knee flexed to 90 degrees
            - One hand over GT; slowly internally rotate the hip (drop the foot outwards)
            - Angle from vertical to palpation of GT at its MOST prominence = ante version angle [20-60 degrees]
            - Antversion about 40 ° at birth and goes to 16 ° at 16 yo.

        - Check for increased tibia torsion

        - Check for Metatarsus Adductus with Beck’s heel bisector [exclude this]
            - Normally passes through 2nd web space
            - Mild = thru 3rd toe
            - Moderate = 3/4 webspace
            - Severe 4/5 webspace
            
            ![Untitled](Knee%20Examination%20made%20Simple%2057dcb28621e44534b0368e6fc97618cb/Untitled%202.png)
            
        - Check Foot progression angle
            - Walk the patient
            - [-5 to 20 degrees] is normal
            - Increased femoral anteversion ➔ Intoeing gait
    - Beighton Score
        
        
- ➔ If OA Valgus knee
    - Emphasize no foot drop by check CPN
- Examine BKA
    - “Note that the patient has a BKA, and a prosthesis next to him. Ideally, I would like him to wear it and to see his walking with it”
    - Examine stump
        - Stump, scar - erythema, infection, skin ulcers, engorgement
    - Knee - ROM - check for any FFD
    - Etiology for BKA - check other leg for PVD/ DM
    - Complete my assessment to evaluate him functionally and how he is coping with an amputation

# Important Questions for Knee Exam

- How do you interprete the Dial test?
    - Place patient prone, ER feet at 30 and 90 degrees.
    - > 10° external rotation asymmetry at **30°** only consistent with isolated PLC injury
    - > 10° external rotation asymmetry at **30°and 90°** consistent with PLC and PCL injury

- What is the rationale behind the pivot shift test?
    - In extension, apply IR and valgus force (this subluxes the tibia anterior)
    - Slowly flex the knee ➔ ITB moves from posterior to Knee COR to anterior to knee COR
    - This exerts a flexor moment of the knee and reduces the tibia.
    - The clunk we feel is the reduction of the tibia.
- What are the pre-requisites of a Pivot shift?
    - Pre-requisite = intact MCL and ITB
- Why is anterior drawer negative but Lachman positive?
    - Medial meniscus as secondary AP restraint causing the ADT to appear negative
    - Hamstrings spasm/tightness
- Any new meniscus examination technique you are aware of?
    - Thesally test
    - Dynamic test; Stands 5 ° flexion at hip and knee; Repeat at 20 deg
