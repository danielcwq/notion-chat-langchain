- What are the ligaments of the wrist? Significance?
    - "There are Dorsal and Volar ligaments; Extrinsic (from outside carpus) and intrinsic ligaments"
    - Volar [Space of Porier between RSC and LRL)
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled.png)
        
        - **Extrinsic** = **Radioscaphocapitate** (RSC), Long Radiolunate (LRL), Short Radiolunate (SRL) + 3 ulnar ligaments (UC, UL, UT)
        - **Intrinsic** = Scapholunate, Lunotriquetrium
    - Dorsal (Buerger's Flap - borders of DRC, DIC ligament)
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%201.png)
        
        - Note the apex is at the **Triquetrium**
        - Extrinsic = Dorsal Radio Carpal (DRC) aka Dorsal Radio Luno Triquetrial
        - Intrinsic = Dorsal intercarpal ligament (DIC)
- What is the space of porier?
    - Area of weakness between Radioscphocapitate and Long Radiolunate
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%202.png)
        
- What is the role of the lunate?
    - Lunate acts as “intercalated torque converter” between the scaphoid that flexes and the triquetrum that extends
    - Attached to either bone by SL and LT intrinsic volar ligaments
    - Any disruption causes the lunate to follow the intact ligament
        - If SL injured, lunate follows triquetrium and extends dorsally = **DISI**
        - If LT injured, lunate follows scaphoid to flex volarly = **VISI**
- Types of carpal instability?
    - **Mayo Classification**
    - CI-Dissociative (CID) = within **same row** – e.g SL (DISI), LT (VISI) injury
    - CI – **Non Dissociative (CIND)** = between rows e.g. Radiocarpal dislocation
    - CI- **Complex (CIC)** = between and within rows e.g. **Perilunate**
    - CI-**Adaptive (CIA)** – from outside carpus = **Radius malunion**
- What are the Gilula lines?
    - 3 lines

- What is the spilled tea-cup sign/ Piece of pie sign?
    - Both signs are **Specific** for lunate dislocation, mayfield 4
    - Piece of Pie on AP
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Spilled Tea cup on lateral
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - Helps to differentiate perilunate vs lunate dislocation.

### Perilunate Dislocation (‼️)

- ‼️What are the types?
    - **Mayfield** Stages
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Mayfield 1 = SL ligament only torn
    - 2 = + RSC Ligament torn (disrupting LC joint)
    - 3 = + LT ligament torn
    - 4 = + DRC ligament failure
    - **Perilunate** **Dislocation** (Mayfield 3) = lunate stays in position but carpus out (4 types) - still held by DRC ligament)
        - [Lesser Arc] Perilunate = pure ligamentous Mayfield 3
        - [Greater Arc - 3 kinds]
            - **Transcaphoid** Perilunate
            - **Transradial styloid**
            - **Trans-scaphoid, transcapitate** perilunar
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - **Lunate Dislocation** = Carpus aligned but lunate out from space of Porier = Mayfield 4
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%208.png)
        
- Which ligament is not torn in perilunate/ lunate dislocation?
    - Short Radiolunate ligament!
- How to reduce?
    - Closed reduction with Tavernier maneuver under **Bier's Block (sedation is not enough)**
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - Chinese Finger traps, elbow 90 deg, Hand traction 5-10 lbs for **10 min [golgi tendon reflex]**
    - **Hyperextened** wrist, **thumb at lunate** (to keep lunte dorsiflexed to allow capitate to clear dorsal rim of lunate)
    - **Flex** wrist with traction maintained
    - Slab, elevate in **Bradford Sling**
    - I will try once and if it fails, will do it under GA to avoid further traumatizing of the soft tissue and worsening of median nerve injury
- If fail closed reduction?
    - Open reduction
    - Volar Approach will be used to decompress median nerve or propylaxtic CT release
    - Close ➔ back slab ➔ CT scan, monitor for CTS
- What if there is median nerve involvement?
    - Need urgent release
    - “I will do an extended CT approach going proximal to the wrist crease, crossing in the ulnar direction to avoid the palmar cutaneous nerve”
    - Need to avoid the palmar cutaneous nerve 5cm proximal to the wrist
- What will you do at 10pm if unable to reduce but no NV?
    - This injury may require open reduction requiring a dorsal incision. As I do not want to jeopardize the hand surgeons planes, I will:
    - Strict elevation on bradford sling till next day
    - With very close monitoring for median nerve symptoms
- What will you do at 10pm if unable to reduce but has median nerve symptoms?
    - I will do a volar open carpal tunnel release and attempt reduction through this
    - If this is not possible, I will just leave the wound open, dress and bandage
    - Allow primary hand surgeon to reduce and repair SL ligaments using dorsal approach
- What are your approaches for definitive management?
    - Unstable fracture and Closed reduction poor outcomes with high risk of recurrence
    - "Goal is to address soft tissue injuries and bony injuries"
    - **Approach** - Always need a dorsal approach. Add volar approach if cannot reduce OR need to release CTS OR choose to fix LT ligament
    - **Volar** – to assess CTS, reduce lunate, repair volar capsule
    - **Dorsal - what flap?**
        - Incision **Between 3 and 4 Compartments**
        - If need to extend, can do Buerger’s flap centered on triquetrium
        - V-shaped flap created along edge of dorsal intercarpal ligament and dorsal radiocarpal ligaments. (only these 2 main ligaments on dorsum)
            
            ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2010.png)
            
- What are your goals of management?
    - Goal: repair dorsal SL ligament, fix fractures if present, pinning of bones
    - **SL ligament** - "Suture anchor" - this is universally accepted; fix via dorsal
    - **LT ligament** - Suture anchor is optional here. Experience says wires is enough; fix via volar
    - Fix other fractures with screws
    - Jin Xi says generally 3 wires - SL, LT, SC
- What bones to pin?
    - THink about the ligaments disrupted - SL, LT and RSC. So pin the SL, LT and SC
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- What are the general expected outcomes for Perilunate/ Lunate dislocation?
    - Patient will have some weakness and stiffness, usually have **80%** of grip strength and ROM (Lim Jin Xi)
- Chronic management of pain?
    - 4CF or PRC

### SL Ligament (DISI) → SLAC + SNAC (‼️)

![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2012.png)

- What constitutes the Scapholunate Ligament?
    - U shape ligament with 3 "sides"
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2013.png)
        
    - 3 components - Dorsal (strongest), proximal and palmar components
- What kind of instability does SL injury produce?
    - Due to injury of SL ligament, Lunate extends with Triquetrum resulting in a DISI (Dorsal intercalated segment instability) i.e. **Lunate goes dorsally**
- Special tests for SL injury
    - **Scaphoid Shift Test aka Kirk Watson's Test for SL ligament**
        - Grab wrist, thumb on scaphoid tubercle
        - Move patient hand from ulnar to radial deviation whilst maintaining pressure on scaphoid tubercle
        - With radial deviation, scaphoid usually flexes but this is prevented by the thumb → so the scaphoid subluxes dorsally off the radius
        - Positive - pain / click
            
            ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2014.png)
            
- What is the classification for SL injury?
    - Classifx by Stages is clinically useful (Marc Garcia 2006) = 5 questions, 6 stages with (1 pre-dynamic stage)
    - 1. partial rupture? = Stage 2
    - 2. Complete rupture? = stage 3
    - 3. Is it reduced?
    - 4. If dislocated, is it reducible? = Stage 4/5
    - 5. is there OA? = Stage 6
- Management of SL injury?
    - Dependant on "**chronicity and congruity"** (very similar to other joint ligament conditions)
        - If < 6 week ➔ K-wire, allow healing of ligament
        - If > 6 week, reducible ➔ **reconstruct with FCR tendon (brunnelli technique)**
        - If > 6 week, irreducible ➔ **STT fusion**

### SCENARIO: SLAC WRIST + SNAC WRIST (‼️)

- What is SLAC Wrist?
    - Progression from SL injury resulting in Lunate extending with Triquetrium to progressive OA
- ‼️ How do you classify **SLAC** [ScaphoLunate Advanced Collapse] wrist?
    - **Watson's** Classification
    
    ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2015.png)
    
    - 1 = Radial styloid Scaphoid arthritis
    - 2 = + **Radio-scaphoid** arthritis (due to loss of SL ligament, Scaphoid keeps extending with the LT))
    - 3 = + **Capitolunate** arthritis
    - 4 = Pan carpal OA
    
    [Watsons.pdf](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Watsons.pdf)
    
- ‼️ How do you classify **SNAC** [Scaphoid Nonunion Advanced Collapse] wrist?
    
    “SNACK Vendor”
    
    - **Vender's** Classification - 3 stages + 1
    
    ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2016.png)
    
    - 1 = Radial styloid Scaphoid arthritis
    - 2 = + **Scaphocapitate** OA (due to humpback deformity, affects the SC joint first; proximal RS joint is still relatively congruent)
    - 3 = + **Capitolunate** Arthritis
    - Finally = pan arthritis and end stage collapse
- How to treat SNAC and SLAC wrist (same algorithm)?
    - Dependant on the stage (non op always an option)
    - 1 = Radial styloidectomy
    - 2 = 4CF or PRC
    - 3 = 4CF since CL joint is affected [if PRC then the arthritis capitate joint will articulate with the radius]
    - 4 = Wrist **Arthrodesis**
- What surgical options before PRC or 4CF?
    - **Wrist denervation** can be done
    - Original techniques uses 8 approaches to resect all 10 articular nerve branches, Now, it is done via 2 or 3 incisions
    - Some of the nerves including the terminal branch of PIN between 3 and 4th EC, terminal branches of AIN, terminal branches of SRN.
- Between 4CF and PRC what are the expected ROM and grip strength?
    - PRC - expect poorer weak strength due to shortening of tendons (theoretical)
    - But overall minimal difference - expect ROM 60%, grip strength 80%
- What other fusions you aware of?
    - Limited intercarpal fusions
    - e.g. Lunate capitate fusion - after excision of scaphoid and KIV triquetrium.
- What is 4 corner fusion?
    
    ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2017.png)
    
    - Fusion of Capitate, Hamate, Triquetrium and Lunate [HTCL]. usually w scaphoid excision
- What is Proximal Row Carpectomy?
    - Capitate will articulate with the radius; so not reccomended if capitolunate joint is already arthritic
        
        ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2018.png)
        
- Any concerns for PRC in young patient? Why?
    - Eventual OA changes
    - Incongruity of the radial lunate fossa with the capitate

- 4CF vs PRC for SLAC and SNAC?
    - **Mulford JHS 2009 systematic review** – no difference in grip strength, function and pain relief
    - Theoretically, PRC does produce an incongruent joint as capitate head has smaller curvature than lunate (try to avoid in younger)
    - Also, PRC should only be done if no Lunocapitate arthritis ➔ if not the new radiocapitate joint will be arthritic and painful as well.

### LT Ligament Injury (VISI) (❌)

- Why does this occur?
    - “Lunate follows scaphoid to flex to volar” = VISI
    - Can be normal variant in ligamentous laxity
- Management?
    - Similar principles to SL injury
    - Acute < 6/52 = repair and K-wire
    - Chronic with + ulnar variance ➔ shortening
    - Chronic with OA ➔ LT fusion
    

### Radiocarpal Dislocation

![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2019.png)

- What are the ligaments that are disrupted?
    - Most of the palmar extrinsic ligaments - RSC, LRL, SRL, UC, UT, UL
- What classification for radiocarpal dislocation?
    - **Moneim Classification** - based on presence of intercarpal dissociation
        - Type 1 = without associated **intercarpal dissociation**
        - Type 2 = with associated intercarpal dissociation
    - **Dumontier** Classification - based on presence of radial styloid fracture
        - Type 1 = Purely ligamentous or only involves small cortical avulsion
        - Type 2 = Associated with **large radial styloid fracture**
            
            ![Untitled](Carpal%20Instability%205c46ae63f7e54b7388962c40dbfd2ad4/Untitled%2020.png)
            
- Acute management of radiocarpal dislocation?
    - Acute reduction under Bier’s block, same principles as perilunate dislocation
    - Slab, monitor for carpal tunnel syndrome
- Is there option for non surgical management?
    - Historically satisfactory outcomes for purely ligamentous injuries
- Definitive management?
    - Operative - principles are to reduce and to maintain reduction and repair torn ligaments
        - Three column fixation
            - Radial column - Radial styloid to scaphoid pinning
            - Intermediate column Lunate facet -
                - SRL and RSC ligament repairs
                - KIV pinning (radiolunate)
            - Ulnar column
                - DRUJ pinning
