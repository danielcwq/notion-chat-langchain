## Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency

![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled.png)

- What is Proximal Femoral focal deficiency?
    - Defect in primary ossification center with failure of normal development in proximal femoral center
    - aka Congenital Femoral Deficiency (CFD)
    - It is a spectrum of diseases with mildest being congenital short femur with is a Aitken Class A.
- What is it associated with that you can examine for?
    - Top to bottom of the limb
    - DDH, coxa vara, **absent cruciate**, genu valgum (Due to lateral femoral condyle hypoplasia), fibula hemimelia (70%), club foot
- What do you know of deficient cruciates in PFFD?
    - Deficient cruciate ligaments is observed in 70-100% of cases
    - Regardless of instability, PFFD patients usually do not complain of knee pain or giving way
    - However leads to risk of knee subluxation or dislocation during lengthening!
- ‼️ What is the classification of PFFD?
    - **Classifx** = Aitken’s

    - Class A = **short femur** + coxa vara (hip stable) = **Congenital Short Femur**
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - B = **Pseudoarthrosis** between head and shaft
    - C = **No femoral head** [has acetabulum]
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - D = No femoral head **and Acetabulum** – only has femoral condyles
- ‼️ What is the **management** of class A PFFD/ Congenital Short Femur?
    - Essentially, this is a normal femur but it is short.
    - Address length ➔ optimize **LLD based on estimated LLD at maturity** [Limb Length Discrepancy (LLD), Hemihypertrophy and associated Syndromes](Limb%20Length%20Discrepancy%20(LLD),%20Hemihypertrophy%20and%209c6b92d367c84e3f8a93733b68a2915f.md)
    - Address **Coxa vara (evaluate HEA)** ➔ proximal valgus osteotomy
    - Address **Valgus knee** ➔ supracondylar osteotomy/ hemiepiphysiodesis
- ‼️ What is the **management** for class B-D PFFD?
    - In this case, there is more severe shortening and possibility of unstable hip joint and options are **Limb lengthening or amputation**
    - Depends on expected **length** at maturity and **hip stability,** foot function
        - If expected length < 50% of contralateral = **amputation**
        - If expected length **> 50%**, consider **salvage**. Salvage surgery will depend on hip stability
            - If **stable** (Aitken B with stable pseudoarthrosis) ➔ Manage as per LLD
            - If unstable ➔ Brown’s Procedure which consists of 2 things
                - 1. **Fuse** to allow stable lever arm (iliofemoral fusion)
                - 2. **Rotationoplasty** and prosthesis to allow ankle to function as knee (**Van Ness Rotationoplasty**)
                
                ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled%204.png)
                
- What is a potential complication of lengthening? Management?
    - **Knee subluxation or dislocation**
    - Mechanism: Force created by hamstring muscles as a result of limb elongation can pull the tibia posteriorly, in particular during knee flexion, leading to posterior subluxation/ dislocation of knee
    - Patient may complain of pain and knee effusion or sudden discomfort in knee
    - Management - lengthening must be slowed down or stopped. Success rate of slowing down is 96% without ligament reconstruction
- What can you consider before lengthening?
    - Can consider ligament reconstruction **before lengthening** if presence of risk factors [Lateral femoral hypoplasia]
    - No consensus on the necessity or this prophylactic surgery as slowing down lengthening is effective in treating subluxations

## Coxa Vara

- ‼️ What are the types of Coxa vara (classification)?
    - Weinstein (by Etiology) – 6 groups
    - Group 1 = **Congenital** idiopathic Coxa Vara
    - Group 2 = congenital with **short femur** (Aitken A)
    - Group 3 = congenital CV with other limb deficiencies
    - Group 4 = with **PFFD**
    - Group 5 = congenital from **SED**, **MED**, **Achondroplasia**
    - Group 6 = **acquired** from **trauma, perthes, DDH**
- What is the definition for congenital coxa vara?
    - Neck shaft angle < 110 degrees
    - Or HEA > 25 degrees
- What are the clinical findings?
    - Painless limp
    - Trendlenburg gait due to shortening of abductor mechanism
    - Waddling gait if bilateral (bilateral DDH), Trendelenburg sign
    - In congenital Coxa Vara - Presents average **6 years old**
    - Reduced internal rotation
    - Shortened limb
- ⚠️ What special sign on XR?

    - Triangular ossification defect in inferior aspect of femoral neck
    - **“ Fairbanks triangle”**
- What angle to measure on XR?
    - Hilgreiner-Epiphyseal Angle [25 deg]
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Hilgreiners horizontal line and a line through the defect adjacent to the metpahysis axis
    - **> 25 ° = Coxa Vara**
- Indications for surgery?
    - Depending on severity
    - HEA **< 40** = usually spontaneously corrects
    - HEA 40 – 60 observe and KIV op
    - HEA **> 60** = consider osteotomy
- What surgery?
    - Valgus derotational femoral osteotomy
    - Aim for neck shaft angle > 140, HEA 35-40
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - May require GT epiphysiodesis
- What are the complications?
    - GT overgrowth, premature closure

## COXA BREVA [Not Congenital]

- What is the difference between breva and vara?
    - Neck shaft angle normal. Only neck is short
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled%208.png)
        
- How do you quantify coxa breva?
    - **Articulo-trochanteric distance (ATD)**
    - Perpendicular distance of the GT tip and top of femoral head along the axis of the femur
    - Confirm breva by measuring neck shaft angle = should be the same
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004/Untitled%208.png)
        
- Most common cause of coxa breva?
    - Treated **DDH** (most common)
    - SCFE, previous septic hip, perthes
- Surgical Management?
    - < 8yo with fatigue Trendelenburg = trochanteric arrest (allow Neck to grow while stopping growth in GT)
        - Can be done prophylactically in perthes
    - > 8 yo = distalization + lateralization of trochanter + valgus osteotomy
