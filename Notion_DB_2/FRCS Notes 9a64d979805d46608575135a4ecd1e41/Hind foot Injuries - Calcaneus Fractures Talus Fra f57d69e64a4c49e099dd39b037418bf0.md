## Calcaneal Fractures

- What other injuries are you worried about?
    - fall from height – possible associated injuries are common – other calcaneum / ankle / tibia / knee / femur / hip / acetabular/ Pelvis / L spine
- Why is the sustenaculum Tali constant?
    - ‘**Constant** fragment’ – Anteromedial fragment consisting of sustenaculum tali and middle facet. *FHL* runs under
    - **3 ligaments** attach to sustenaculum tali = tibiocalcaneal ligament, talocalcaneal, calcaneonavicular (spring ligament)
- How many articulating facets does the calcaneum has?
    - **4 articulating facets** – anterior, middle (on sustenaculum tali) and posterior with talus and cuboid articulating facet

    - **Bohler’s Angle** (25 – 40)
        - Line 1 = highest point of posterior facet to highest point of tuberosity
        - Line 2 - Highest point of anterior process to highest point of posterior facet
    - **Angle of Gissane** (120 – 140)
        - Line 1 = along posterior facet
        - Line 2 - anterior process to inferior portion of posterior facet
    - **Harris Axial view** – varus deformity, lateral wall blow out
    - **Broden’s view** - look at subtalar joint (for intraop assessment)
    
    ![Untitled](Hind%20foot%20Injuries%20-%20Calcaneus%20Fractures%20Talus%20Fra%20f57d69e64a4c49e099dd39b037418bf0/Untitled%203.png)
    
- CT scan - see what?
    - Sagittal - extent of collapse
    - Coronal - widening of heel, varus, lateral wall blow out
    - Axial - Sanders classification, size of constant fragment
- ‼️ How do you classify?
    - Essex- Lopresti – tongue type vs joint depressed (75%)
        - **Joint depressed** = Secondary line exits anterior to the attachment of achilles tendon
        - **Tongue type** will extend posterior to the posterior tuberosity
        
        ![Untitled](Hind%20foot%20Injuries%20-%20Calcaneus%20Fractures%20Talus%20Fra%20f57d69e64a4c49e099dd39b037418bf0/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Sanders Classification based on **30 degrees semi-coronal view** (which is **perpendicular to the posterior facet**), at widest point of posterior facet
        - 1 = undisplaced
        - 2 = 1 # line (2 fragment)
        - 3 = 2 # line (3 fragment)
        - 4 = comminuted
    
    ![Untitled](Hind%20foot%20Injuries%20-%20Calcaneus%20Fractures%20Talus%20Fra%20f57d69e64a4c49e099dd39b037418bf0/Untitled%205.png)
    
- How do you acutely manage?
    - Jones bandage, no back slab, elevate

- Calcaneal Fractures - **What is the Definitive Mx? = Patient and Injury factors**
    - **Tongue type** – watch for open, skin necrosis, front slab, screw fixation
    - **Joint depressed (75%)**
        - **No consensus on optimal treatment.** Several studies show no different in outcomes for op vs non op for comminuted sanders 4 (Buckley 2002 et al, Agren et al., UK HEFT Trial). However, my decision will be based on Patient and injury factors
        - **Injury Factors** - comminuted, subtalar joint disruption ➔ high risk of secondary OA. Fracture favours fixation for 2 reasons
            - Prevents OA
            - Even if OA, better functional outcomes and fewer wound complications if for fusion later (Radnay 2009 JBJS)
        - **Patient factors** - young male, worker, PVD? DM?
            - Based on buckley paper, which found that sub group that benefited from op are women, age < 30 with light work load, no work man com
            - Patient factors do not exactly favour ORIF
        - **As such, will discuss with patient,** and have him make an informed decision.
- What is your surgical aim?
    - Restore **Bohler** angle and Calcaneal height
    - Restore **width** for shoe fitting
    - Restore **varus** malalignment
    - Restore **Subtalar** joint congruity
- Which approach will you use? What structure to be careful of?

    - **Lateral extensile** – Between TA and Fibula; inline with 5th Ray along border of glaborous skin ➔ Full thickness flap (avoid devascularization of Lateral calcaneal ArterY)➔ Subperiosteal dissection ➔ "Retract with K-wires with meticulous skin handling"
    - **Sinus Tarsi Approach** – Tip of fibula, *horizontal* to foot for 3-4 cm ➔ EDB retracted superiorly, Peroneal tendon retracted inferiorly
    - **Which approach better?** Bai et al. Meta-analysis 2018 - STA has lower wound complications (2% vs 20%), no difference in other outcome scores.
    - Beware SURAL nerve
- Any technical pearls?
    - Schanz pin at calcaneus tuberosity to correct varus
    - Using laminar spreader to open the central defect
    - Place K-wires and raft screws under posterior facet, fixing to the constant fragment
    - Fill defect with allograft/ autograft or bone substitutes
    - Apply plate
    - MIS approaches
- Screw vs plate?
    - No difference
    - Pitts et al. FAI 2019 No difference in restoration of angles, complication rates of screws vs plates.
- Do you need bone graft?
    - Autografts - ICBG - Singh et al. JOT 2013 - no difference on outcomes or complication rates. Graft had better restoration of radiographic angles
    - Allografts - Duymus et al. JFAS 2016 - no difference in clinical outcomes. Graft had better radiographic restoration of bohler angle
    - Bone substitutes

- What do you know of the UK HEFT trial?
    - UK Heel Fracture Trial (HeFT)
    - Aware of the UK HEFT Trial - RCT of 151 patients. which found no difference in op vs non op.
        - Strict exclusion criteria – got rid of sanders 3 and 4. This leads to selection bias as only mild calcaneal fractures were selected.
        - Only 30% randomized
        - All EL approach
    - Because of strict exclusion criteria, so found out that no difference in outcomes

- What do you know of the Buckley trial?
    - 2002 JBJS Buckley et al.
    - RCT op vs non op using extensile lateral approach of 512 patients. **No difference in outcome** in displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.
    - **Subgroup that benefit (3)**– Women, Age < 29 with light work load, No workman compensation

- Will you consider Primary fusion for calcaneum fracture?
    - “I am aware that this is controversial. In Buckley’s paper 25% eventually require fusion within 2 years. In a separate RCT, Buckley compared ORIF + ORIF and subtalar fusion and found no difference functionally. “
    - Buckley 2002 RCT - Sanders 4 (25% need fusion within 2 years), Bohler angle < 0 at presentation
    - If 25% sanders 4 need fusion, should we do primary fusion?
    - **Controversial**.
    - Buckley et al. 2014 JOT RCT. Sanders 4 ORIF (17 patients) vs ORIF + primary subtalar fusion  (14 patients)-  no difference functionally. Primary fusion may reduce cost and time off work. Authors concluded that it remains the choice of surgeon and patient.

- Does fixation help with later fusion?
    - Radnay 2009 JBJS
    - Compared non op to fusion vs ORIF to fusion, better functional outcomes and fewer wound complications if had initial ORIF

## Talar Neck Fractures

- ‼️ Why is the Talus prone to AVN?
    - 1. **60%** articular cartilage
    - 2. No muscular attachments at all - so no benefit of blood supply from attachments
    - 3. Retrograde blood supply
- What is Blood supply to Talus?
    
    ![Untitled](Hind%20foot%20Injuries%20-%20Calcaneus%20Fractures%20Talus%20Fra%20f57d69e64a4c49e099dd39b037418bf0/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - ATA ➔ Dorsalis Pedis
    - PTA (2)➔ **Medial deltoid** (practical point - MM osteotomy to avoid injury here) and **Tarsal Canal Artery**
    - PPA ➔ Sinus Tarsi Artery (lateral)
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the classification of talar neck fractures? AVN risks?
    - **Hawkin’s Classifx** (predicts risk of AVN) - ST, TT, TN
    - 1 = **undisplaced** **10%**
    - 2 = **Subtalar** involvement **25-50% (**Vallier modification)
        - 2A subluxed only – 0%
        - 2B dislocated – 25%
    - 3 = + **Tibiotalar** **90%**
    - 4 = + **Talonavicular 100%**
- What is the definitive management of Talar Neck Fractures?
    
    <aside>
    🔑 “Patient and injury factors”
    
    </aside>
    
    - Injury - high rates of AVN and eventual collapse and OA
    - Patient - PVD, DM
    - Goal = Usual stuff + prevent **varus** malunion
    - **Options**
        - Screw fixation – AP vs PA screw. (usually multiple headless screws in view of high cartilage coverage)
        - Mini fragment plates if comminuted - **medial plate** to prevent varus collapse
- What is your surgical approach to the Talar Neck?
    
    <aside>
    🔑 “Dual incision, aware of SPN and Saphenous nerve and vein”

    - **Anteromedial** approach – just **medial to Tib ant;** going along axis of 1st MT
        
        ![Untitled](Hind%20foot%20Injuries%20-%20Calcaneus%20Fractures%20Talus%20Fra%20f57d69e64a4c49e099dd39b037418bf0/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - This approach avoids the DP NV bundle as it is medial to the tib Ant
    - **AL** – between tib/ fib to 4th ray, elevate EDB [Watch for SPN!]
        
        ![Untitled](Hind%20foot%20Injuries%20-%20Calcaneus%20Fractures%20Talus%20Fra%20f57d69e64a4c49e099dd39b037418bf0/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Exposure – **MM osteotomy** (because want to preserve as much blood supply as possible. Remaining blood may be coming from deltoid ligament!)

    - 
- What will you follow up for? Any special sign?
    - Back slab, NWB x 6/52
    - Follow up and monitor for Hawkin's sign
    - **Hawkin’s Sign** = Resorption of bone at subchondral = viable! [Feature of neo-angiogenesis]
- What complications?
    - Subtalar OA (Vallier et al. **54%**) ➔ fusion as salvage

    - AVN
    - Varus Malunion

- What are the risk factors of Post Talar neck fracture AVN?
    - ✘ Time to surgery (So it is ok to wait for soft tissue), Open fracture
    - ✓ Initial extent of dislocation
    - **Heather Vallier** et al. 2014 80 patients with talus fracture:
        - None had AVN for Types 1 and 2A
        - 30% in 2B
        - 31% in Type 3
        - Delay in ORIF does not increase risk of AVN
        - Open fracture does not increased risk of AVN

## Subtalar Dislocation

- What do you know about subtalar dislocation?
    - Dislocation of Talonavicular and Talocalcaneal joint
    - Rare
    - Commonly a/w with 5MT #, malleolus #, calcsaneus #
- Classification of subtalar dislocation?
    - Medial (65-80%) - most common; due to inversion and plantar flexion
    - Lateral - due to eversion
    - Anterior
    - Posterior - extreme plantar flexion
- What prevents reduction in medial dislocation?
    - NOT peroneal tendons
    - "Irreducible medial subtalar dislocation has been associated with the talar head **"buttonholing" through the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB)** muscle"
        
        [Anatomical considerations of irreducible medial subtalar dislocation - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8919409/)
        
- Management of subtalar dislocation?
    - Check NV
    - Closed Reduction ➔ Check NV
    - If unable to closed reduce, can try with calcaneal pin to allow better traction ➔ fail ➔ Open reduction incision based on direction
        - If **medial** dislocation ➔ Lateral approach to release **EDB**
        - If **lateral** dislocation➔ medial approach to release the post tib.
    - If unstable after reduction ➔ Talonavicular K-wire
    - Otherwise, Immobilise for 4-6 weeks.
- Outcomes of subtalar dislocation?
    - **Jungbluth et al.** JBJS 2010 Series of 23 subtalar dislocation with no bony injury. Reduced with immob for 6/52. Good outcomes. Direction of injury no difference.
        
        [Isolated subtalar dislocation - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20360512/)
        

## **Dislocated Talus**

- Is it common?
    - Rare
- Management of dislocated talus?
    - **Always** requires open reduction
    - Either through open wound
    - Or dependant on direction
        - Medial = dorsomedial approach
        - Lateral = anterior approach
    - Adjuncts to reduction
        - Tibiocalcaneal external fixator distraction
        - Osteotomy of malleolus

## **Extruded Talus**

- Rare
- Management of extruded Talus?
    - = Discard vs reimplant
    - **Smith JBJS 2006** shows reimplantation is safe
    - Reimplant helps with biomechanics
    - Debride, Wash with Chrlohexidine [non alchohol due to **cartilage**] , reimplant
    - Counsel for infection KIV remove
