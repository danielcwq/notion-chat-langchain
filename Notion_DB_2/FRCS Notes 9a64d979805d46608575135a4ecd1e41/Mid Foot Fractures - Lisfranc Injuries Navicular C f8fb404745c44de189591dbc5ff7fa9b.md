## Lis Franc Injuries

- What is the Lis Franc Joint? Ligaments of the Lis Franc Joint?
    - Tarsometatarsal joint
    
    ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled.png)
    
    - 2-5 MT held by inter-metatarsal ligaments
    - Each MT has a tarsometatarsal ligament
    - 2nd MT is recessed into middle cuneiform between medial and lateral cuneiform ➔ keystone structure
- Components of the Lis franc ligament? Strongest?
    - Lis franc Ligament = between Medial cuneiform and 2nd MT base
    
    ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - **Plantar** – most **critical**
    - **Interosseous** – **strongest**
    - **Dorsal** – **weakest** (so dislocation is dorsal)
- ‼️ XR Lines? (4AP, 1 Lat, 1 Oblique)
    - **AP** -
        - Fleck Sign,
        - Widening of 1/2 MT
        - Disrupted line from medial border of 2MT to medial middle cuneiform
            
            ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%202.png)
            
        - Mill's line - usually medial column line intersects the 1st MT. But if there is a shift of the joints laterally, then it will not bisect
            
            ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%203.png)
            
    - **Oblique** - 4MT medial border and cuboid medial border
    - **Lateral** - Dorsal subluxation of MT 2

## SCENARIO: HIGH ENERGY LIS FRANC

- ‼️ Classification of high energy lis franc?
    - Myerson Classifx
    - A = **total** incongruity = all 5 go one direction
    - B = **Partial** incongruity = either column affected
    - C = **Divergent** = Both medial and lateral column split
- Acute management in EMD?
    - Back slab KIV Ex fiX
    - CT scan
- Surgical Approach?
    - Myerson’s 2 dorsal approach with adequate skin bridge
    - Between MT1 and MT 2
    - Along MT 4
- Surgical plan?
    - In this fracture which is a bony lis franc, i plan for fixation rather than fusion.
    - “Principle is to fix from medial to lateral”
    - Stabilize MT1 to MM (retrograde screw or plate)
    - Stabilize Medial cuneiform to MT 2 with lis franc screw
    - Then proceed to MT 3 to lateral cuneiform
    - MT4/ MT 5 = mobile column so trans fix with K-wire
- Plate vs Screw?
    - Theoreteically Plate does not cause joint destruction
    - [Frank alberta et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15960913/) Biomechanically no differences. Between dorsal plate and transarticular screw. Joint surface destruction by 3.5mm screw is 2% for medial cuneiform, 3% for MT1 and 4% for MT2
    - I will choose based on extent of comminution
        - Plate – if comminution
        - Screw if no comminunition
- Any other fixation devices?
    - Aware of suture button - but theoretically unable to control for multiplanar instability
    - Bioabsorbable magnesium screws have been described
- ‼️ Fuse or fix a Lis franc injury?
    - ORIF vs Fusion is controversial with no consensus.
    - Coetzee JBJS 2006 RCT of **41** patients with **ligamentous** Lisfranc ➔ ORIF vs fusion. Better outcomes at 2 years with fusion with higher return to preinjury activities 92% vs 65%.
    - ALso, **25%** of patients undergoing ORIF needed subsequent fusion due to symptomatic OA
    
    [Coetzee lisfranc.pdf](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Coetzee_lisfranc.pdf)
    
    - However, Smith et al. 2015 Systematic review found no difference in outcomes. Hardware removal rate is higher for ORIF
    
    [Smith .pdf](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Smith_.pdf)
    
    - In my practice, I will opt to fuse ligamentous lis franc in view of the higher risk of OA with no bone to bone healing.
- Post op rehab plan?
    - NWB x 6 week
    - Hardware removal = no consensus, not routine.
    - I will allow low impact activities (swim, cycling)
    - Plan for hardware removal at 4-6 months
- Is Fleck sign considered bony or ligamentous?
    - Controversial. In Coetzee’s original paper in 2006, Lis franc with fleck sign considered to be ligamentous.

## SCENARIO: ISOLATED LIS FRANC (SPORTS)

- Classification for low energy lis franc
    - Nunley and Vertullo in sporting lis franc injuries
    
    ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - Stage 1 = Undispalced
    - 2 = widening > 2mm on AP XR; no dorsal subluxation
    - 3 = Dorsal subluxation on lateral XR
- Management for low energy Lis franc?
    - Nunley and Vertullo type 1 = Non op with NWB for 6/52
    - Surgical mx is indicated for other grades as it is unstable injury
    

### Navicular Fractures

- What is the blood supply of the navicular?
    - Dorsally by dorsalis pedis
    - Medially by posterior tibial artery
    - With central watershed area.
    
    ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%206.png)
    
- ‼️ What is the classification for Navicular fracture?
    - **Sangeorzan** - based on plane of fracture and degree of comminution (orthobullets)
    - Type 1 = transverse  fracture with dorsal fragment
    - Type 2 = oblique vertical fracture - a/w **adduction** deformity
    - Type 3 = Central or lateral comminution - a/w **abduction** deformity
    
    ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%207.png)
    
- Management principles of Navicular fracture?
    - Principle = achieve articular anatomical reduction, bone void management and stability
    
    - Indications - joint incongruity > 2mm, medial column shortening > 3mm
    - Type 1 = ORIF via Medial Utility incision with lag screw fixation (Dorsal to plantar direction)
    - Type 2 = Plate or screw
    - Type 3 = mini fragment plates +/- ICBG; fix concomitant cuboid fracture
    - May need bridge plating of navicular and the cuneiforms; depending on plate availabilities if insufficient bone stock
        
        ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%208.png)

        - D - cauterise superficial veins ➔ navicular
    - +/- additional dorsomedial incision (Same plane as Anterior approach to ankle)
        - P - between Tibialis anterior and EHL, over the navicular
            
            ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%2012.png)
            
        - I - Just medial to EHL
        - D - at the level of incision, ATA and DPN are medial to EHL
            
            ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%2013.png)
            
- What adjuncts can you use to help?

- Management of **Navicular Stress fractures**?
    - NWB in cast x 6/52 (Shorter than < 6/52 have poorer outcomes!)
    - Average time to RTS is 4.9 months
- WB or NWB in cast or just immob?
    - Torg et al. Meta-analysis in AJSM 2010. Statistically significant better with NWB compared to WB cast (96% vs 47%)
- Op vs non op management of stress fractures?
    - Torg et al. Meta-analysis in AJSM 2010 - no difference in NWB cast vs op. statistically favour non op. (96% success vs 82%)
    - Potter et al. BJSM retrospective study of 32 fractures. no difference in functional outcomes between op vs no op at 10 year follow up. Op had higher incidence of continued tenderness at dorsal navicular prominence.
- Management of Avulsion fractures?
    - If minimally displaced/ small ➔ NWB in cast
    - If big fragment ➔ lag screw fixation

### Cuboid Fractures

- What is the eponymous name of a cuboid fracture?
    - “Nutcracker” fracture = MOI is valgus stress (eversion) leading to compression of cuboid between calcaneus and metatarsals
        
        ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- Approach to cuboid?
    - "Lateral utility approach" aka Dorsolateral approach to cuboid [Same plane as Sinus Tarsi Approach]
    - Incision - from distal fibula to base of 4th MT
        
        ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%2017.png)
        
    - Danger - Sural nerve

        ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%2018.png)
        
- Principles of managing cuboid fracture?
    - **Principle** = restore articular congruity, lateral column length and chopart and lisfranc joint stability
    - Indications - > 1mm articular displacement, > 3mm shortening of lateral column
- Surgical technique?
    - Bring lateral column up to length by inserting pin to calcaneus and 5th MT base ➔ distract
    - Fill void with ICBG
    - Bridge plating vs primary arthrodesis
- Reduction aids?
    - Distraction pins

    - Zone 1 = Base
    - 2 (Jones Fracture) = Meta-diaphyseal junction, involving the inter-metatarsal joint
    - 3 = Shaft
- What are the attachments to the 5MT
    
    ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%2021.png)
    
    - Peroneus Brevis + lateral band of plantar fascia attach to base

- What is the significance of a Jones Fracture?
    
    ![Untitled](Mid%20Foot%20Fractures%20-%20Lisfranc%20Injuries%20Navicular%20C%20f8fb404745c44de189591dbc5ff7fa9b/Untitled%2022.png)
    
    - 2 blood supply to the 5MT base - Metaphyseal vessels and Diaphyseal Nutrient Artery
    - Watershed area between these 2
- What is the management?
    - Zone 1 = air cast boot FWBAT
    - Zone 2 = Can Non op, but advice risk of Nonunion in sedentary patients. Consider op if elite or competitive athletes
        - Roche et al. KSSTA 2013 meta-analysis of 26 studies. Non union rates 76% vs 96%
    - Zone 3 = Op if elite or non union
- What is the surgical technique?
    - 4.5mm cancellous screw, 40-55mm in length as IM screw
    - Smaller diameter screws lead to non union
    - NWB x 6/52
- What is the reccomended screw diameter?
    - 4.5mm vs 5.5mm screw diameter - no difference
    - Porter et al. FAI 2009 compared 2 diameters in athletes. No difference in union rates or outcomes
    - Shah et al. FAI 2001 Cadaveric study. No difference in load to failure (332N vs 335N)
- How to do you manage nonunion?
    - Revision fixation with bone graft with large diameter screw 5.5mm
