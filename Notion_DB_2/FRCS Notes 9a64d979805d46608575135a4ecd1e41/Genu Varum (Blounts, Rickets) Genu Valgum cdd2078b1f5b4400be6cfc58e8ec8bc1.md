## GENU VARUM (‼️ )

- ‼️ What are the causes of paediatrics genu varum?
    - **Physiological** - normal on Salenius curve
    - **Pathologic** - Bilateral- off the Salenius Chart (I - TITDMS)
        - Idiopathic = **Blount’s** (diagnosis of exclusion) [usually bilateral]
        - Secondary to:
            - **Dysplasias** - achondroplasia,  SED and MED (though more valgus)
            - **Metabolic** - Ricket’s
            - **Syndromic** - Down’s syndrome
    - Pathologic - Unilateral
        - **Trauma** - malunion, physeal bars
        - **Infection**
        - **Tumor** - osteochondromas, enchondroma (though more valgus)
- What is your approach to genu varum?
    - Describe picture
    - My concern is if this is pathological or physiological. Assess with Hx, PE and Invx
    - **Hx** = unilateral, duration, family history (MED, SED, achondroplasia, **age** of walking, TIT
    - **PE** = Unilateral, **Weight**, **Female** Cover test to confirm not tibia torsion. If BILATERAL - look for features of Rickets
    - Invx - XR with Salenius Curve
- What special clinical test? Purpose?
    - Cover test = **cover tibia** and look at knee. if knee is straight or varus = genu varus. If after covering, knee is valgus then its ok.
    - It is to differentiate **internal tibia torsion** from blounts.
        
        ![Untitled](Genu%20Varum%20(Blounts,%20Rickets)%20Genu%20Valgum%20cdd2078b1f5b4400be6cfc58e8ec8bc1/Untitled.png)
        

- What are the Angles to measure on XR for angular deformities of knee? Give me 5.
    - **Tibiofemoral** angles on Salenius curve.
        - 0/2/4/6 yo = 15/0/10/5
            
            ![Untitled](Genu%20Varum%20(Blounts,%20Rickets)%20Genu%20Valgum%20cdd2078b1f5b4400be6cfc58e8ec8bc1/Untitled%201.png)
            
    - **Drennan's Meta-diaphyseal angle** (MDA)
        
        ![Untitled](Genu%20Varum%20(Blounts,%20Rickets)%20Genu%20Valgum%20cdd2078b1f5b4400be6cfc58e8ec8bc1/Untitled%202.png)
        
        - metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle (MDA) is formed between a line connecting the most distal points of the medial and lateral proximal tibial metaphyseal beak and a line perpendicular to a line parallel to the lateral tibial cortex
        - **> 16** = blounts
        - > 11 in < 2 year = likely progress
        - **< 9**= likely physiological
    - **Epiphyseal metaphyseal angle** (EMA)
        
        ![Untitled](Genu%20Varum%20(Blounts,%20Rickets)%20Genu%20Valgum%20cdd2078b1f5b4400be6cfc58e8ec8bc1/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - Angle between epiphysis and line from tip of meaphyseal beak to midpoint of tibia plateau
        - [normal < 20 °]
    - **Mechanical Axis deviation** by zones
        - Look at where mechanical axis passes through the knee
        - Divid the Tibia plateau into 4 quarters. Zones 1/2/3 (3 is out of knee)
            
            ![Untitled](Genu%20Varum%20(Blounts,%20Rickets)%20Genu%20Valgum%20cdd2078b1f5b4400be6cfc58e8ec8bc1/Untitled%204.png)
            
    - **mLDFA and MPTA** to determine femur or tibia deformity [more for valgus knees]
        - mLDFA (mechanical lateral distal femoral angle) = angle between line from center of femoral head to center of knee // distal femur joint line
        - MPTA (Mechanical proximal tibia angle) = angle between tibia axis and tibia plateau
        - Both angles normal is 87 °. Measuring the angles can tell us if the valgus is originating from tibia or femur
            - In this case, mLDFA  is 77 while MPTA is 87, so deformity is in femur ➔will benefit from DFO
                
                ![Untitled](Genu%20Varum%20(Blounts,%20Rickets)%20Genu%20Valgum%20cdd2078b1f5b4400be6cfc58e8ec8bc1/Untitled%205.png)

    - **Langenskoid**
    - Stage 1 = Early beaking of **metaphysis**
    - 2 = worse beaking of **metaphysis**
    - 3 = downsloping of **epiphysis**  [Depression]
    - 4 = downsloping epiphysis **crossing physis** [Step off]
    - 5 = epimetaphyseal **bridge**

- What is management for **< 3 years old**?
    - **Early stages 1-2** = Valgus producing brace to correct based on "Heuter Volkman's law" ➔ follow up w 6 monthly XR ➔ if progress may need op
    - **Late stage (once epiphysis involved)** =
        - Growth plate modulation
        - Proximal tibial osteotomy
            - Aim to do before 4 yo to reduce recurrence
            - Multiple types described
            - Familiar with the Rab osteotomy which is a oblique, biplanar osteotomy allowing correction of internal rotation and varus deformity[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832880/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832880/)
            - Goal = correct to slight valgus as physeal abnormality still present (over correction); or you can do an epiphysiodesis on the lateral side also ➔ can LEAD to LLD
        - Medial tibia plateau elevation
        - External Ilizarov frame
- If **age > 3**?
    - Bracing not effective
    - Depends on bone age
        - Growth modulation in form of **hemiepiphysiodesis**

## RICKETS

- ‼️ What is rickets?
    - A defect in **mineralisation** of osteoid matrix caused by inadequate calcium and phosphate before physeal closure; **normal osteoid**.
    - Occurs at the zone of provisional calcification of the Hypertrophy zone
- ‼️ 3 types of rickets?
    - Vit D **resistant** (most common)
        - Aka **familial hypophosphatemia** due to impaired reabsorption of phosphate in kidney ➔ low phosphate ➔ directly lead to problem with mineralization
        - **XL-dominant** - **PHEX** gene or Mutations involving **FGF-23 gene**
    - Vit D **dependent**
        - Type 1 = renal enzyme defect (**AR** inheritance) - unable to convert
        - Type 2 = end organ receptor defect (**AR** inheritance)
    - **Nutritional**
        - GI malabsorption issues
        - Lack of sunlight ➔ low vit D ➔ low calcium
- ‼️ What is the triad of Vit D resistant Rickets?
    - Hypophosphatemia
    - LL deformities - valgum or varum
    - Stunted growth rate

        - Idiopathic (diagnosis of exclusion)
        - Secondary due to -
            - **Dysplasias** - MED (screen other joints), SED (screen spine),
            - **Metabolic** - Rickets (usually varus), Other Metabolic diseases

        - Evaluate mLDFA and MPTA to correct appropriate (commonly in distal femur
- How do you do a DFO?
    - Can either be lateral opening or medial closing osteotomy
    - **1. Calculate correction angle** (cf [HTO](https://workflowy.com/#/fc7c49063653)) - angle between 2 lines (mechanical tibiofemoral angle)
        - Line 1 = from femoral head to center of tibia interspinous point
        - Line 2 = line from center of ankle to tibia interspinous point
            
            ![Untitled](Genu%20Varum%20(Blounts,%20Rickets)%20Genu%20Valgum%20cdd2078b1f5b4400be6cfc58e8ec8bc1/Untitled%2012.png)
            
    - **2. Medial closing vs Lateral opening wedge?**
        - Wylie et al. 2016 Arthroscopy Systematic review and meta-analysis.
        - No difference in outcomes and revision rates for either technique
        - However **medial closing wedge is theoretically better** closing wedge - can WB, lower rates of delayed union.
        - Lateral opening wedge if smaller, medial closing wedge if bigger correction (theoretically lower rate of non union)
