- Neurovascular - DP, PT, Foot drop

# Hip Examination Expanded

### Standing

- Dress down to underwear
- Lift up underwear to look for hidden bikini scars
- Mention that you **do not see any obvious hernia**
- Look for pelvic obliquity, LLD

### Walk - check gait

- **Antalgic** - reduced stance phase
- **Trendelenburg** - drop in pelvis on opposite side
- **Trendelenburg lurch -** Patient lurch towards ipsilateral stance limb to shift COG to ipsilateral side to compensate
- **Fused hip** - pelvis elevated by exaggerated plantarflexion of opposite ankle and circumduction of stiff leg to provide clearance (may not be short)
- **Short leg** - apparent if > 2cm shortening. Tried to bring the foot to the ground by tilting the upper body downwards with contralateral knee flexion. Stance phase is equal as compared to antalgic gait
- **Drop foot gait** - Forefoot touches ground first. (slapping)

### Trendelenburg test

- Initially described from the back but now more commonly done from the front
- "Knees together, bring foot backwards". to avoid them flexing the hip instead
- Demo - knees together and lift legs behind you
- Ask patient hold shoulder, squat down hold his pelvis, and do the test

### Lie down and palpate

- Palpate bony prominences - ASIS, palpate groin, GT

### **Apparent** limb length - measure from xiphisternum

- “in his natural lying state i am measuring the apparent limb length”,
- “the shortening is x cm”

### Square the pelvis

- Squaring means you feel for both ASIS, use forearm to connect both ASIS and position the limb same position relative to your line

### True Limb length

- True leg length - ASIS to MM
    - if discrepancy ➔ ascertain if above or below femur ➔ Galeazzi test
    - Galeazzi ➔ look from front, then look from side
- If Tibial shortening ➔ Allis Test by turning prone to confirm tibial shortening [Omit]

- If Femoral shortening ➔ “Digital **bryant’s** triangle”

### **Thomas** Test

- Before this, check knee to make sure no FFD
- “No FFD of the knee”
- Flex both hips ➔ extend one leg ➔ repeat other leg.
- Report the angle between bed and back of thigh

### Check ROM

- Flexion - fix pelvis by **holding ipsilateral ASIS**
- ER - 50 deg
- IR - 40 Deg
- Abduction and adduction. - fix pelvis by holding contralateral ASIS

### Check **Impingement**

- FADIR
- Patrick's test/ FABER (posterior impingement or early OA)

### Check Neurovsacular

- DP, PT
- Foot drop

# Important Questions

- What is the trendelenburg sign?
    - “coronal plane abnormality where there is a truncal tilt due to abductor mechanism failure”
- What are the causes of trendelenburg sign?
    - **Fulcrum** problem - hinge abduction, head collapse secondary to Perthes, Trauma, Infection, AVN
    - **Lever** arm - short femoral neck e.g. coxa breva, coxa vara
    - **Power** -  muscle problem from spinal cord, **polio**, **L5** radiculopathy, **NMJ** issue, **trochanteric** osteotomy that did not heal well,
- *Reasons for false positive or negative trendelenburg test?*
    - False positive = due to **pain** from OA, AVN
    - False negative = arthrodesed or ankylosed hip
- ⚠️ How do you interprete true and apparent shortening differences?
    - **Apparent 5cm, True 5cm**
        - If True shortening = apparent shortening ➔ means **NO compensation**
    - **Apparent 2cm, True 5cm**
        - True shortening > apparent shortening → means **incomplete compensation** taking place
    - **Apparent 5cm, True 2cm**
        - True < Apparent  ➔ means **not only is there shortening**, but in addition, there is an **adduction contracture** that leads to more shortening!
- How do you do thomas test in 3 scenarios?
    - Ipsilateral Knee fusion - need to hang leg off the couch to do either at the side or below the bed.
        
        ![Untitled](Hip%20Examination%20made%20Simple%20fe3867258167417b958f407d5a208d24/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - Contralateral THR - “i will do a “patient controlled thomas test”. Ask the patient to flex himself”
    - Contralateral fused hip - lift the heel instead to move the hip
    - Ankylosed spine - do as per normal. Thomas’s test tests for lumbar spine compensation in fixed flexion of hip. In AS, there is no more compensation, so just do and mention
- How much shortening does adduction deformity lead to?
    - Adduction makes the limb appear shorter – **each 10° of fixed adduction adds a further 3cm of apparent shortening** to any real shortening that the disorder may have caused.

# **Other special tests**

- How do you check for rectus femoris tightness?
    - Duncan Elly’s test
    - Prone, knee flexed maximally and see if pelvis rises
        
        ![Untitled](Hip%20Examination%20made%20Simple%20fe3867258167417b958f407d5a208d24/Untitled%209.png)
        
- How do you assess for ITB tightness?
    
    **Ober's**
    
    - Patient lies on unaffected side, with unaffected hip maximally flexed
    - Affected hip flexed and abducted 45 °
    - Slowly extend ➔ normally, when brought into extension, it is possible to adduct the hip to midline
