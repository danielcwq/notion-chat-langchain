- Types of cartilage in body?
    - **Hyaline** Cartilage
        - Type 2 Collagen
    - **Fibrocartilage**
        - Type 1 Collagen
        - Found in intervertebral disc, tendon ligament insertion
    - **Elastic** Cartilage
        - Type 2 collagen
        - Found in auricle of ear, epiglottis, meniscus
- Function of cartilage?
    - **Lubrication** - very low coefficient of friction of 0.002 (30 x better than arthroplasty)
    - Participates in Fluid film lubrication by boosted, weeping
    - **Shock** absorption
- Properties of cartilage?
    - Avascular, aneural, alymphatic, non immunogenic
- ⚠️ DRAW structure of cartilage.

    - "Arcades of Beninghoff"

    - **Zone 1** = **lamina splendens**. Parallel fibers, 1-3 cell thick of flattened chondrocytes. Macrophage-like features, H2O ++++. Collagen > Proteoglycan to resist shear stresses
    - **Zone 2** = Oblique Oblique Fibres
    - **Zone 3** = **Vertical**. **PG +++>> Collagen (compression)**, H2O minimal. Chondrocytes ++
    - **Tidemark** - boundary between uncalcified and calcified cartilage. cell-free zone.
    - **Calcified zone** - contains Collagen X, Calcium hydroxyapatite
- Significance of tidemark?
    - Superficial = Above tidemark = do not heal
    - Deep = Below tidemark = fibrocartilage type 1 collagen
- Contents of cartilage?
    - Water 80% - helps in lubrication
    - Type 2 collagen = tensile resistance - 60% dry weight
    - Proteoglycan (most is Aggrecan) – **compression** resistance
    - Chondrocytes - 1% only!
    - No blood supply
- DRAW proteoglycan aggecan

    - Hyaluronic acid, link proteins, core protein, Chondroitin and Keratan sulphate. (Remember as KC. K is nearer to HA)
    - Withstand COMPRESSION forces
- Difference between knee and ankle cartilage and shoulder?
    - Shoulder - thicker superficial layer due to more shear stresses (and thiner transitional and radial layers)
    - Ankle - thicker radial/ deep layer due to more compressive stresses
- What is the difference in biomechanical properties of fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage? What are the implications?
    - Fibrocartilage demonstrate poorer biomechanical properties - e.g. less stress relaxation, less creep
    - Result is that more forces is transmitted down to the subchondral bone ➔ resulting in subchondral bone damage.

## SYNOVIUM

- ‼️ What is synovium?
    - Composed of 2 layers
        
        ![Untitled](10%20Cartilage%20and%20Synovium%20b1138ae7b548488691317ec60648aed2/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - **Intimal lining** 2-3 cell layers in depth. Contains the synovial cells that produce synovium fluid. No basement membrane.
    - **Subintima lining** contains fibroblasts, blood vessels, immune cells, macrophages. Important role in inflammatory arthritis
- What are the cells in synovium and their function?
    - Type A = **macrophages**
    - Type B = **fibroblast** like cells that produce synovial fluid
    - Type C = **intermmediate** cells
- ⚠️ What is synovial fluid and its 3 characteristics?
    - What it is? Dialysate of blood plasma  without clotting factors, RBC or Hb. Contains hyaluronate, plasma proteins
    - 3 Characteristics
        - **Non-newtonian** = shear stress not proportionate to shear rate) - leads to Pseudoplasticity and thixotropicity
        - **Pseudoplastic** = *Less viscous with increased rate*. undergoes shear thinning (i.e. as movement increase, more, less viscous)
            - Due to alignment of HA molecules as shear rate increases
        - [T for time] **Thixotropic** = *Less viscous with time at constant shear rate.* undergoes shear thinning **with time** when sheared at constant rate i.e. when walking at constant speed, over time, fluid is less viscous)
- What happens to synovial fluid in RA? Difference in OA?
    - Enzymatic degradation of Hyaluronic Acid results in loss of non-newtonian properties ➔ less effective lubricant (less shear thinning and stuff)
    - Compared to OA - HA is not degraded and thus maintain non-newtonian properties
