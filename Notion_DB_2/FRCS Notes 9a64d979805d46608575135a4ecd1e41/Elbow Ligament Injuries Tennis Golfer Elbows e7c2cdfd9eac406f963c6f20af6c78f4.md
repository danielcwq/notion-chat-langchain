### Posterolateral Rotatory Instability PLRI ❗️

- What are causes of PLRI?
    - Due to insufficiency of the LUCL (Primary restraint to PLR stability)
    - Can be due to malunion of Supracon ➔ Cubitus Varus ➔ PLRI (Tardy Ulnar nerve if present)
- What are the clinical tests?
    - All are on the basis of **forearm supination** and **axial loading** with a **valgus force**
    - Lateral Pivot shift test

    - Chair rise test/ push up test

- Mx of Acute PLRI?
    - Treat as simple dislocation
- Mx of Chronic PLRI?
    - LUCL recon with graft (**PL**/ gracilis grafts)
    - Distal humeral osteotomy if Malunion

### MCL Injuries

- What is the main ligament in question?
    - Ligament in question – Anterior band of AOL
- What is it called in paeds? Eponymous name?
    - Paeds – **Little leaguer’s Elbow** (Apophysitis of medial epicondyle/ avulsion)
- What are the stages of throwing and which stage causes the highest stress to which structures?
    - 6 stages - wind up, early cocking, late cocking, acceleration, deceleration, follow through

    - **Late cocking** stage - highest elbow valgus stresses leading to MUCL injuries, GIRD
    - **Deceleration** stage - Eccentric contraction of muscles in shoulder required to slow down
        - "most harmful phase" - a/w SLAP, biceps tendon injuries
- In Adults what they get?
    - Adults Bone stronger than ligament ➔ Ligament injury
- What special test?
    - Milking manoeuvre - flexed elbow, with valgus force by pulling on thumb laterally

- What looking for in XR?
    - Avulsion of Medial epicondyle and the displacement
- Acute Mx?
    - Rest from throwing
    - If avulsion > 2cm ➔ ORIF of epicondyle avulsion
- Chronic, symptomatic management of elbow MCL insufficiency?
    - **Tommy John Surgery** reconstruction of MCL anterior band ligament
    - Graft options – auto or allografts
    - Docking options - interference screw/ tunnels/ cortical buttons
- Why is there better healing of the MCL ligament?
    - Chronic tensile gravitational loads occur on the lateral ligaments.

## Tennis Elbow

- What muscle tendon is implicated in tennis elbow?
    - ECRB
- What are associated conditions?
    - Radial tunnel syndrome in 5%
- What is the classic histology in tennis elbow/ plantar fasciitis? What is the difference between tendinosis vs tendonitis?
    - Keyword = **"Angiofibroblastic Hyperplasia"**
    - In tendinosis, there is no acute inflammatory cells. Instead there is granulation-like tissue containing immature fibroblasts and disorganized non functional vascular elements
    - Due to repititive tensile overload
    - **What areas** - tennis elbow, achilles tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, golfer elbow
- What are your differential diagnosis for recalcitrant tennis elbow?
    - Neurological - Radial tunnel syndrome
    - Joint - Radiocapitellar arthritis, Radiocapitellar **plica**
    - Trauma - PLRI
- Management of tennis elbow?
    - Non op - "Counter force Brace", PT, eccentric training, steroids injection, PRP, ESWT
    - Op - ECRB/ EDC release
- What are the other causes of **clicking elbow/ lateral elbow pain**?
    - “Synovial fold syndrome” - Most common plica is the posterolateral fold
    - Usually have 4 folds that resorbs - anterior fold, posterior fold, posterolateral fold and the lateral olecranon fold

## GOLFER'S ELBOW

- Associated conditions with golder's elbow?
    - Ulnar nerve symptoms in 23-60%
- Management differences from tennis elbow?
    - Avoid steroid injection, shock wave therapy due to presence of ulnar nerve.
