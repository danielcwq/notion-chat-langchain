## Limb Length Discrepancy

- ‼️ What are the causes of Limb length Discrepancy?
    - Lengthening
        - Hemihypertrophy and its causes
            
            
            - What are the causes of hemihypertrophy?
                - Idiopathic = “hemihypertrophy”
                - **Syndromic causes of Hypertrophy** -
                    - Proteus syndrome
                    - Klippel Trenaunay syndrome [Look for triad]
                    - Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome [Macroglossia]
                    - N**eurofibromatosis** [Look for cafespot]
                    - Maffuci syndrome
                - Makanov et al. JBJS 2018 Most common is Idiopathic (27%), Hemihypertrophy (23%), Fibula hemimelia (28%)
            
        - Overgrowth from trauma (femur shaft #)
    - Shortening
        - Congenital vs Acquired
            - Acquired
                - TIT
                    - **Trauma** - with physeal bar
                    - **Infection** - tom smith arthritis, polio
                        
                        ![Tom Smith Arthritis](Limb%20Length%20Discrepancy%20(LLD),%20Hemihypertrophy%20and%209c6b92d367c84e3f8a93733b68a2915f/Untitled.png)
                        
                        Tom Smith Arthritis
                        
                    - **Tumor** - MHE
            - Congenital
                - **Femur** - PFFD, Congenital short femur, coxa vara (and its causes), Coxa Breva (and its causes) previous perthes, DDH
                - **Shin** - fibula hemiemlia, tibial hemimelia
- What Invx?
    - Long film XR
    - Spine XR for scoliosis
    - Left hand XR for bone age

- What are the **complications of LLD**?
    - Pelvic obliquity → Spine issues - Increased back pain, functional Scoliosis
    - Hip OA - long vs short side? - not completely understood
        
        ![Untitled](Limb%20Length%20Discrepancy%20(LLD),%20Hemihypertrophy%20and%209c6b92d367c84e3f8a93733b68a2915f/Untitled%201.png)
        
        - When standing with the weight equally distributed on both legs (position of at attention), patients with leg length discrepancy have their pelvis and sacrum tilted to the side of the short leg, resulting in relative deterioration of femoral head containment and lateral flexion of the spine
        - However, in single-leg stance this effect is not present due to the horizontalization of pelvis and sacrum by the gluteal muscles
        - Studies that show increased OA in shorter limb:
            - [Chan Kim et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6160315/#R18)
        - Studies that show increased OA in longer limb
            - [Gofton et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5089638/) postulated that longer limb had excessive loading
    - Equinus contracture of ankle on short side due to chronic compensation
    - Inefficient Gait
- ‼️ What is the scoliosis direction for LLD?
    - Left side is the expected deformity
    - It is usually convex towards SHORTER extremity
    - But this is only in 1/3 of the patients.
    - 2/3 are opposite. not sure why.

### GENERAL MX OF LLD

- Why should we strive to equalize limb length?
    - To avoid the complications of LLD
- ‼️ How do you manage this patient with LLD?
    - Goal is limb length equalization, level the pelvis and keep lumbar spine straight
        - Exception - hemiplegic Lower limb (paralytic LLD) this is because it will do more harm. THis is to **allow clearance** of the limb during gait.
    - 1. Calculate LLD at maturity
        - There are several methods but I use the Arithmetic or Menelaus Rule of Thumb Method. It has **2 assumptions**:
            - Growth at the 4 physis in the LL are 3/9/6/3 mm a year respectively.
            - Growth ceases at **16 yo for male**, **14 yo for females**
        - Accuracy compared to others?
            - Other methods
                - Moseley Straight line graft
                - Paley multiplier method
                - Anderson-Green methods
            - John Birch et al. JBJS 2019 compared White melanus Arithmetic method and Anderson-green charts. Arithmetic method was more accurate.[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31169579/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31169579/)
            - Makarov et al. JBJS 2018 compared **White Menelaus, Anderson Green, Moseley and Multiplier methods**. Multiplier method least accurate. White-Menelaus method most accurate and simple to calculate without need for consecutive XR to construct graphs or charts
        - Arithmethic method
    - 2. Decide treatment based on LLD at maturity
        - **0-2cm** = no treatment, shoe raise
        - **2-6cm** = epiphysiodesis
        - **6-20** = lengthening +/- shortening
        - **> 20** = prosthesis (NVB limitations)
    - Example 1 = of Epiphysiodesis
        - 10 year old male, Distal femur fracture. Now 1cm difference
        - Assuming maturity at 16 year old, there will be 6 years left
        - Distal femur = 9mm/ year.
        - The LLD at maturity will be 1cm + 9 x 6 = 6.4cm
        - Treatment will be epiphysiodesis of the contralateral femur.
        - By Maturity, the LLD will be kept at 1cm!
    - Example 2 = of Shoe raise
        - 15 year old male, previous distal femur Fracture
        - Now LLD 1cm
        - Left 1 years.
        - LLD at maturity, assuming 16 = 1cm + 9 mm = 1.9cm
        - By algorithm, can use shoe raise
- Options of Surgical equalisation?

    - Acute Shortening
    
    ![Untitled](Limb%20Length%20Discrepancy%20(LLD),%20Hemihypertrophy%20and%209c6b92d367c84e3f8a93733b68a2915f/Untitled%203.png)
    
- Lengthening principles and options?
    - Max lengthening - about 20% till max 5cm - principles as per distraction osteogenesis (3 phases)
        - **Latent** 2/52, **Distraction** 1mm/day, **Docking** 2 x distraction phase.
        - External fixation index ~ 5mm/ month overall
    - **2 options of lengthening**
        1. Ex fix with lengthening along mechanical axis
        2. OR Telescopic rod with lengthening along anatomical axis - can lead to valgus)
- Complications of lengthening?
    - If too long - joint contractures, joint dislocations, vascular and nerve injuries
    - Fractures
    - Non union
    - If you use Ex fix - risk of pin sites infection
    - Deformity - varus valgus in anatomical lengthening with monorails.
- What is the principle behind epiphysiodesis?
    - The 'Hueter-Volkmann Law' proposes **that growth is retarded by increased mechanical compression, and accelerated by reduced loading in comparison with normal values**.
- Principles of shortening?
    - Easier than lengthening
    - Issue with reduced muscle tension but by 6 weeks should tighten up.

## Hemihypertrophy

- Pathophysiology of hemihypertrophy?
    - Cause - not known with many theories. Could be related to vascular to lymphatic flow.
- How will you approach this patient with hemihypertrophy?
    - Goal of assessment is to determine cause of hemihypertrophy if it is idioathic or syndromic
- Hemihypotrophy vs hemihypertrophy?
    - Need to evaluate in light of the other limbs
- What investigations will you do? Any other organs?
    - Further XR,
    - Abdominal US - for Wilm's tumor

### Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

- Diagnosis based on clinical findings - macroglossia, defects of anterior chest wall, mental retardation
- A/w embryonal tumors e.g. Wilm’s tumor, hepatoblastoma

### Neurofibromatosis

[Pediatric Syndromes and Others](Pediatric%20Syndromes%20and%20Others%2038140804d779489c8a8ca26dfcb6fa5d.md) 

### Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS)

- A form of rare VASCULAR disorder
- ‼️ What is the triad associated with KTS?
    1. Port-wine stain
    2. Hypertrophy (sometimes hypo)
    3. Lateral varicose veins
- What examination finding in KTS?
    - Look for the triad
        - Port wine stain
        - Hemangioma - distinct, linear border that respects midline
        - **Varicose veins** - "Klippel Trenaunay Vein" - large lateral superficial vein that begins in foot and enters at thigh/ gluteal region
    - Also look for blue sclera due to intraocular venous malformations

- Management of KTS?
    - Vascular for endovenous laser/ radiotherapy (venous stripping, ligation, excision are contraindicated)
- Orthopaedic Management of KTS?
    - Mainly for LLD

### Proteus syndrome

- Named after greek God who could change shape
- Presence of hemangiomas and lymphangiomas
- Rare disorder characterised by overgrowth due to disorder in AKT1 gene
