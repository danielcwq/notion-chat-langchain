- Definition of osteoarthritis?
    - Progressive loss of articular cartilage and subchondral bone remodelling
- ‼️ What is the pathogenesis of OA?
    - **Initiating** event is fatigue wear of articular cartilage
    - Leads to disrupted proteoglycan, collagen meshwork ➔ increased porosity, so increased water content
    - With increased water ➔ stiffness drops, young Modulus REDUCED
    - Secondary damage to Chondrocytes leads to release of cell enzymes (Matrix MetalloProteinases) that further break down matrix
    - Meanwhile, compensatory increased on chondrocytes attempt to repair
- Causes?
    - Primary
    - Secondary - Post traumatic, gout, AVN
- Macroscopic Changes?
    - Softening, fibrillation, pitting, erosion, delamination, denudation
- Microscopic changes? What components?
    - 3 components to look at - Matrix, Cells and Enzymes
    - **MATRIX**
        - Proteoglycans - reduced = loss of compression strength
        - Collagen network - reduced = loss of tensile strength
        - Water content - due to increased porosity of weakened collagen network
    - **Cell** - CHONDROCYTES - more active as try to compensate
    - **Enzymes** - **Matrix Metallo Proteinase (MMP)** - more active as activated by inflammatory cytokines
- What are key difference from normal aging?
    - Differences are in terms of [think from pathogenesis]
    - 1. Collagen and Proteoglycan loss - leads to reduced stiffness
    - 2. Water content - increased in OA
    - 3. Stiffness/ Young Modulus - decreases
    - 4. Chondrocytes - increased in OA to compensate
    - **Aging** has
        - reduced water, with
        - maintained collagen and proteoglycan (so stiffness and Young Modulus increases).
        - Chondrocytes also reduced.
        - Increase in AGEs (advanced glycation end-products) that increase collagen cross linking ➔ more stiff ➔ more brittle ➔ susceptible to fatigue failure
- ‼️ What is the key distinguishing factors between OA and Aging?
    - OA has increased IL-1 and MMP
- ‼️ What are AGEs?
    - advanced glycation end-products
    - Normally found as part of aging
    - Products of (1) **uncontrolled, (2) non-enzymatic, (3) glycation and oxidation between proteins and sugars**
    - Accumulate as part of aging, making tissue more stiff but brittle
    - Increasing susceptibility to fatigue failure ➔ delamination ➔ Osteoarthritis
- What is the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis?
    - 1. Immune mediated inflammatory response in joints ➔ releases enzymes
    - 2. Synovitis and pannus formation
    - 3. Destruction of hyaline cartilage and peri-articular attenuation of soft tissue
    - 4. Instability and abnormal mechanics ➔ secondary osteoarthritis
