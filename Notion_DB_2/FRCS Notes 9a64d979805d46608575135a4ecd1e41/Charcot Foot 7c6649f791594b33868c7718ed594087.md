- What is Charcot Foot? (3 words)
    - It is the **progressive**, **non-infectious** **destructive** disease of joint
- What are the Causes?
    - **Congenital** -
        - CMT, spinal dyrsaphism (myelodysplasia)
        - syringomyelia [can also cause LL charcot; case report for hip charcot]
    - **Acquired** -
        - DM, alcohol,
        - Infection - syphillis, leprosy
- ‼️ What is pathogenesis of Charcot?
    - 3 theories - neurotraumatic, inflammatory, Neurovascular
    - **Neurotraumatic** - Loss of sensory protection, repeated trauma
    - **Neurovascular** - autonomic dysfunction ➔ hypervascular ➔ increased resorption
    - **Inflammatory** - inflammatory cytokines activate osteoclasts
- What causes the rocker bottom deformity?
    - Due to midfoot collapse
    - The prominence can either be plantar subluation of talus, cuboid

- How do you assess the patient?
    - **Triple assessment to confirm diagnosis, rule out infection, elicit severity**

    - **Hx**
        - Symptoms - duration, fever, pain
        - Risk factors - DM, leprosy, syphilis, CMT,
    - **PE**
        - Differentiate from OM –
        - Sensation - monofilament
        - **Claw** toes - imbalance in intrinsics vs extrinsic. Intrinsics tend to be less functional; so excess FDL activity
- What is the classic physical exam sign to differentiate from OM?
    - blanching on elevation > 5-10min (erythema due to hyepervascularity)
- What investigations?
    - **Invx** – to differentiate infection vs Charcot
    - Bloods - FBC, CRP ESR
    - Imaging –
        - XR,
        - MRI (TRO Deep collections),
        - **WBC labelled scan [**hot in OM, cold in neuropathic joints]
    - CT scan to evaluate for consolidation?
- ‼️ How do you classify Charcot?
    - By stage = **Eichenholtz** FCC
        - 1 = Fragmentation (1-6 month),
        - 2 = Coalescence,
        - 3 = Consolidation/ remodelling
    - By joints involved = **Brodsky**
        
        ![Untitled](Charcot%20Foot%207c6649f791594b33868c7718ed594087/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - 1 = **midfoot** - Lis franc joints +
        - 2 = **Peritalar** - Talocalcaneal, Chopart joints (TN and CC) (same joints as triple fusion)
        - 3 = **Tibiotalar**
            - 3A = tibio talar
            - 3B = calcaneum
        - 4 = mixed
        - 5 = forefoot
- **Mx** - Acute Stage 1,2 – Goal? **MDT with endocrinologist!**
    - Goal = Aim is to **achieve a consolidated stage 3 foot while preventing deformity**
    - Total Contact Cast (increases total surface area to distribute WB forces) ➔ Need **repeat casting weekly/ 2 weekly** ➔ until **swelling subside Then convert to Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker** (CROW)

    - Bisphosphonates – no evidence
    - F/U for temperature (2 degree cut off. If > 2 ° , still active. If < 2 °, can withdrawal immobilization. ), serial XR
- Mx of an Charcot with an ulcer?

    - Need to **rule out infective ulcer** ➔ Bloods and MRI to look for OM or deep collections
        - **Infected** ➔ Op to debride ➔ eradicate infection ➔ Plan for definitive op.
            - Can consider TA release at same time to reduce plantar loading
        - **Non Infected** ➔
            - Not recommended to do exostectomy at acute stage as it can lead to further mid foot collapse
            - Offload and protect ulcer with TCC until consolidation stage (assess clinically with temperature or CT scan for fusion) ➔ Exostectomy and deformity correction
- **Mx – Chronic Stable Stage 3 Charcot? Deformity Correction**
    - Aim = Achieve a plantigrade, functional, stable, painless foot
    - **Non op**
        - Accomodative shoe wear to accommodate deformities e.g. rocked bottom
    - **Op**
        - Indications – Foot at risk– deformity that threatens skin and is unstable.
    - Planning for Op
        - Check Vascular supply
    - Surgical options:
        - Soft tissue procedures ➔ TAL **lengthening** (very good to reduce plantar loading
        - Exostectomy/ **bumpectomy**
        - Deformity correction and fusion
            - **Internal** fixation – superconstructs described by Sammarco et al. – **3 principals** and **3 fixation techniques**
                - 3 principles
                    - extension of fusion **beyond zone of injury**
                    - include joints not affected;
                    - ‼️ adequate **bone resection** to improve soft tissue envelope ; minimal soft tissue dissection
                - 3 fixation techniques –
                    - 1 plantar plates,
                    - 2 multiple locked plates,
                    - 3 axial screw fixation
            - **External** fixation – standalone or combined with IF (circular fixator)
            - TTC **nailing**
        - Amputation
- What is the risk of infection in charcot foot?
    - As high as 35%

- What is the internal fixation principles in Charcot Foot? Principles?
    - **Internal** fixation – superconstructs described by Sammarco et al. – **3 principals** and **3 fixation techniques**
        - 3 principles
            - extension of fusion **beyond zone of injury**
            - include **joints** not affected;
            - adequate bone **resection** to improve soft tissue envelope ; minimal soft tissue dissection
