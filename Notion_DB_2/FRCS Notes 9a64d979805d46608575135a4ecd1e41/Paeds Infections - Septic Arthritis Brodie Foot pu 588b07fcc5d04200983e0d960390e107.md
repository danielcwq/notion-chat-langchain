### Brodie’s Abscess

- What is it?
    - Subacute **haematogenous** OM
    - Median duration of symptoms before diagnosis - 12 weeks!
    - Localised **Tibia** abscess with no history of previous acute illness
    - Staph aureus > staph epidemidis
    - Systematic review: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6367194/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6367194/)
- ‼️ What Classification for Brodie Abscess?
    - **Gledhill** Classification
    - Type 1 = solitary localised radiolucent lesion
    - 2 = + Cortical erosions
    - 3 = + Cortical hyperostosis in **diaphysis** without onion skinning
    - 4 = + onion skin layering in **diaphysis**

- What invx?
    - XR - well circumscribed bony lesion

    - MRI - **Penumbra** sign = rim of vascularized granulation tissue around a bone abscess cavity that has a higher T1 signal intensity than the cavity itself

- Mx?
    - Surgical debridement as abx cannot penetrate cavity

### Paeds Septic Arthritis

- Pathophysiology of Paeds septic arthritis?
    - **Hairpin loops** in **metaphysis** with low flow ➔ bacterial lodge ➔ no phagocytic cells in this area ➔ small areas of abscesses and AVN.
- ‼️ Which joints does septic arthritis occur in Paeds?
    - Does not occur in KNEE as not **intra-articular metaphysis**
    - Occurs in proximal humerus, **radial head**, Hip , **distal fibula**
- Hip septic arthritis - leg position?
    - Hip is in position of comfort – flexed, abducted and externally rotated
- What is the differential diagnosis?
    - Transient synovitis of the hip.
- ‼️ ⚠️ Any criteria to suspect septic arthritis?
    - Kocher Criteria. (note that no CRP)

- ‼️ Any more recent papers for paeds Septic Arthritis?
    - Singhal et al. JBJS 2011 in study of 300 hips came up with 2 variable algorithm
        - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22058311/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22058311/)
        - Looked at Temp, WB status, TW, CRP
        - **CRP > 20** was strongest independent risk factor for septic arthritis
        - Combined CRP > 20 with inability to weight bear 74% probability of septic arthritis.
        - If both not present, < 1% probability of septic arthritis
    - Caird et al. JBJS 2006 also found that **CRP > 20** is strongest independant risk factor for septic arthritis
        - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16757758/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16757758/)
- Other investigations?
    - MRI
    - US guided Hip aspiration
- If MRI shows no collection but has OM changes on femoral neck - do you need to drain?
    - Depends on the duration of disease and the presence of subperiosteal abscess in the bone. Antibiotics alone is suitable IF no abscess.
    - I will surgically debride if there is abscess or no clinical improvement within 48 hours with Abx
- How do you drain the hip?
    - Because main blood supply is posterior, to avoid AVN, I will drain the hip from anterior approach
    - Open drainage via Smith Peterson Approach [Hip + Pelvis Approaches](Hip%20+%20Pelvis%20Approaches%207fa0baff5c5e4ef88e58e0f9ff20553f.md)
    - Will not insert a drain, will mobilize immediately.
- Chronic Sequelae?

    - “Tom Smith Arthritis”
    - Complete destruction of femoral head.
    - How do you know if the head is reduced? - MRI scan under sedation/ GA
    - **ddx?**
    - Presence of acetab = cannot be DDH or PFFD
    - No head at all = cannot be Perthes
- If patient has **chicken pox** few weeks before. whats the concern?
    - Post chicken pox, patient is more immunocompromised, expect more aggressive disease, so treat more aggressively
    - May lead to tom smith - pre-empt family
    - Also, bug is usually secondary **streptococcus A infectio**n, rarely primary viral septic arthritis
    - Chicken pox itself also can lead to aseptic arthritis

### Foot Puncture Wound

![Untitled](Paeds%20Infections%20-%20Septic%20Arthritis%20Brodie%20Foot%20pu%20588b07fcc5d04200983e0d960390e107/Untitled%206.png)

- What is the concern?
    - Puncture wounds in children can result in serious sequelae requiring formal operative procedures
    - JPO 1994 Jarvi et al. Case series of 15 patients. All had **pseudomonas** cultured
- Management of Foot puncture wounds?
    - High suspicion for Pseudomonas infection
    - Aggressive debridement in OT
    - Multidisciplinary with ID for IV Abx that cover Pseudomonas e.g. **piptazo**
    - Prepare for long hospital stay ~ 3 weeks
    - Watch closely for recurrent or delayed infection
- Where is the pseudomonas from?
    - No consensus
    - Not from the child's foot. Study by Miller failed to culture pseudomonas in 100 normal children
    - A study cultured pseudomonas from the inner foam layer of sneakers

### Meningococcal Septicaemia

- Medical emergency - MDT, IV Abx - Benzylpenicillin
- Can lead to loss of limb due to amputation from infection
