# Shoulder Exam made Simple

### [STAND AND LOOK]

- Expose adequately
- **Front** - shoulder level, deltoid contour, scar in deltopectoral groove, obvious deformities, no ACJ deformity, no arthroscopy scars
    - **Flex biceps - look at biceps** [try to pick up biceps rupture; if not second catch is at muscle test]
    - Special signs
        - Anterosuperior escape sign?
        - Geyser sign?
- **Sides** - scars
- **Posterior** - wasting of muscles, scars, cervical scoliosis
    - Sometimes, infraspinatus wasting is more obvious because trapezius muscles may dip into the SS fossa and thus mask the wasting. Thus you need v significant wasting of the SS to see
- **Axilla** - lift arm up to look for scars

### [Check ROM - AROM and PROM]

- Palms up and flex all the way up
- Palms up and abduction all the way, repeat from back
    - Go to back and repeat - “scapula moving symmetrically, no winging noted”
- ER - limited ER is either Frozen shoulder OR OA shoulder
- Go behind and do IR

### [PALPATION]

- Along SCJ, clavicle, ACJ, GT, Bicipital groove
- Biceps groove
- Supra and infraspinatus fossas

### [SS and BICEPS POWER TESTS]

- **Supraspinatus** - fully internally rotated to put deltoid at maximum mechanical disadvantage (aka empty can test)
    - press above the elbow to prevent triceps from assisting!
    - at 30 ° to coronal in scapula plane
- **Infraspinatus** - ER/ lag sign (can bring to max ER then let go see if it swings back in)
- **Teres** Minor (bring to max ER then let go to see if swings down)
    - Horn blower sign - elbow flexes and wrists drops to the mouth (not go into IR)
- **Subscapularis** - gerber lift off test
    - Belly press test
- **Speed's** test - arm in full supination and extended [You may pick up biceps rupture here]
- **Yegason's** test - elbow flexed and resisted supination [You may pick up biceps rupture here]

### [IMPINGEMENT AND SLAP TESTS] = trying to replicate impinging of cuff by coraco-acromial arch

- **Neer's** sign (vs Neer's test = pain abolished with injection with LA)
    - hold coracoid and scapua
    - Full Internal rotation to bring GT right under the coracoacromial arch
    - Plane of scapula (same plane as empty can test) and elevate to 90 degrees
    - ➔ follow on with hawkin’s test at this position
- **Hawkin's** test - internally rotate at 90 °
    - Similarly, trying to catch the cuff muscles under coracoacromial arch
    - ➔ Continue on with scarf test
- **Scarf** test - hand to other shoulder, apply compression force, palpate ACJ
- Superior Labral - **O’Brien's** test
    - Flex to 90, **adduct** to 15, **IR** and flex against resistance - in this position, biceps will fall off the the groove - painful
    - When you **repeat in supination**, biceps will fall back in the groove and thus no pain

### [INSTABILITY TESTS - SIT DOWN]

- **Anterior** labrum
    - **Sulcus** sign - look for groove.
    - **Apprehension** and Jobe relocation test
        - Apprehension - bring from IR to ER
        - Augmentation by pushing
        - Relocation if positive
        - Release
    - ~~Load and shift (Not asked)~~
- **Posterior** labrum
    - **Jerk**/ Kim test - axial load from scapula plane then bring it into adduction *Pain and clicking is the problem
- **Beighton** sore

### Check neurovascular tests

- Radial pulse
- MUR nerve screen

### Check Function -

- 3 areas - hand to mouth, head and back pocket

### [COMPLETE]

- Offer Examine C-spine

# Scenarios and add-ons

### 1. Massive RC tear/ RC arthropathy

- Comment on **pseudoparalysis**: "Inability to actively flex and abduct shoulder >90, but has full PROM, and intact neurology”
- "I am evaluating the Teres Minor to look for **CLEER** - combined loss of active elevation and external rotation which is an indication for Lat Dorsi Transfer with RTSA”
- 3 extra things to check [Post grad]
    - Check **Lat Dorsi** by putting patient hand on shoulder in front and ask to press down
    - CHeck **Trapazius** by shrugging of shoulders
    - Check **deltoid** function for Reverse total - deltoid contraction and sensation

### 2. Frozen Shoulder ➔

- 2 extra things to check
    - Neck - no obvious neck **thyroid** masses
    - Hands for **dupuytren's** disease
- Take **history** for diabetes, smoking, autoimmune conditions, cardiac disease and history of trauma and shoulder pain causing secondary frozen shoulder

### 3. Long head biceps rupture ➔

- Do hook test to confirm it is proximal and not distal rupture

### 4. Thoracic outlet compression syndrome

- **Adson's** test - vascular component
    - hand on radial pulse
    - Extend shoulder and abduct shoulder
    - Look towards him and take a deep breath - this reduces the infra-clavicular space
- **Roo's** test - neurological component
    - Extend and hyperabduct shoulders to reduce infraclavicular space
    - Patient will feel neurological symptoms

### 5. Multidirectional Instability

- Do as per above. But may not find anything until we do the labral tests! So stay calm…

### 6. Cyst at SS or Supraglenoid

### 7. Winging

- Pick up abduction screen from the back. Make mention. Hope examiner point out
- push wall confirm. Medial winging
- "want to confirm this is isolated LTN and not part of brachial plexus injury" [Post grad]
    - Screen sensation and motor by Asia scoring
    - Check Rhomboid, Supra spinatus and Horner’s
- Check function - ask handedness and check touch head, mouth and back pocket
