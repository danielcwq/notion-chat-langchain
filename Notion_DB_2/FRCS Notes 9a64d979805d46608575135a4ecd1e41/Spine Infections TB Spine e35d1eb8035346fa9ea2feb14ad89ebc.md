## Spinal Infection

- Spectrum of disease?
    - Spondylodiscitis ➔ Pyogenic Vertebral Osteomyelitis ➔ Epidural Abscess
- Where are the most common location in spine? (compared to TB)
    - 60% in L / 40% in T / 10% in C
- What is the pathogenesis?
    - **Hematogenous** seeding,
    - **adjacent** spread or
    - innoculation in spine surgery

- What is the pathogenesis of Hematogenous spread mets/ infection/ TB to spine? Usually which part affected first?
    - Due to **valveless venous system of Batson’s**  Found **within the spinal canal**
    - The **spinal** veins, **pelvic** and **thoracic** veins drain into the batson’s plexus which is valveless
    - ➔  Seeding at **end plate** where there are "low flow vascular anastamoses" ➔  infection spread across endplate ➔  Spread to VB

    - Usually going to **vertebral body first** then pedicles (so affects **MOTOR** first)
        - So we get the Tuli’s 5 stages of Pott’s Paralysis
- What bacteria?
    - Staph Aureus 60%/ Streptococcus/ Gram negative Bacteria
    - Salmonella in sickle cell
- What investigations?
    - Bloods - FBC, CRP, ESR
    - MRI with contrast
    - CT guided biopsy
    - **Cardiac ECHO** - 30% has endocarditis!

- What is the difference in MRI for Infection vs Tumor vs TB?
    - **Infection** - disc involvement + rim enhancing lesion.
    - **TB** - cold abscess spreading across ALL with PRESERVED disc with paraspinal absccess
    - **Tumor** - PRESERVED disc, T1 also reduced signal due to loss of bone marrow from tumor infiltration (fatty bone marrow is replaced by cancer cells)
- Indications for surgery in spine infection?
    - Neurology, Instability, Deformity (NID), Biopsy, not responding to Abx, epidural abscess
- Management for Spondylodiscitis and PVD?
    - Principles of treatment
        - 1. Obtain bacteriology via biopsy and start Abx
        - 2. Protect neurology, maintain stability with bracing
        - 3. Drain collection if present
    - **Antibiotics** - mainstay of treatment:
        - Hold before giving culture directed Abx
    - **Abx Duration:** 6/52 vs 12/52 – LANCET paper RCT 2015 no difference.

    - **Bracing** – improve pain and prevent deformity
- What are the surgical principles?
    - Goals = excise infected bone, decompress neurology KIV stabilization if necessary
    - Posterior – decompression laminectomy
        - Indication – posterior abscess, no spondylodiscitis
    - Anterior – debridement and strut grafting
        - Indication – Anterior abscess, with VB and disc involved
        - Option of strut – titanium mesh cages, tricortical iliac crest (Auto vs allograft), rib, biular strug graft
    - Post op - insert drain, continue IV Abx, trend inflammatory markers, multidisciplinary with ID for duration

- Can we instrument in same setting if spine is unstable in Spine infection?
    - Hey et al. 2017. Cohort study of 84 patients. No difference in terms of reop for Abx only vs Abx with debridement vs Abx with debridement with instrumentation.
    - Postulated that **biofilm formation in spine is offset by good blood supply of axial skeleton** when compared to the appendicular skeleton

- How will you drain a concomitant psoas abscess?
    - Consider anterolateral approach
    
    ### Lumbar - AnteroLateral Retroperitoneal Approach
    
    - P - lateral position, can use AMSCO table to break table
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.13.12 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.13.12_PM.png)
        
    - I - **12th rib** and oblique towards the **lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle** about 5cm lateral to midline
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-06-24 at 9.13.56 PM.png](Spine%20Approaches%20Fusion%20Approaches%206afbde67bbfb4604a0ea8cc19287aa26/Screenshot_2022-06-24_at_9.13.56_PM.png)
        
    - S - Skin ➔ Subcut ➔ 3 muscles - EO, IO, TF ➔ Plane between retroperitoneal fat and fascia that overlies the psoas muscle ➔ sweep everything anteriorly ➔ ligate lumbar vessels from aorta to mobilize it anteriorly

## Tuberculosis Spine

- Usually affect which level?
    - 40% T/ TL 20%/ L 37%
- What is a cold abscess?
    - Collection of pus with no surrounding inflammatory response
- What is the classical deformity?
    
    ![Untitled](Spine%20Infections%20TB%20Spine%20e35d1eb8035346fa9ea2feb14ad89ebc/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - Knuckle (1 VB), Gibbus (2 VB), Rounded Kyphosis (> 3VB collapse)
- What XR features?
    - Early - local osteoporosis of end plates of adjacent vertebrase; narrowing of disc space
    - Late - paravertebral shadow, anterior wedge compression collapse with kyphotic deformity
- What investigations? What stain?
    - MRI with contrast - whole spine. 15% has skip lesions
    - Sputum cultures ➔ if respiratory cultures +ve, need protection intraop
        - **Ziehl Neelson** stain
    - **CT guided biopsy**
    - CT spine
- What are the types of bone destruction on CT scan?
    - Fragmentary type
    - Lytic type
    - Subperiosteal
    - Sclerotic
- ‼️ What signs are you looking for on imaging in childhood TB?
    - Rajasekaran 4 Spine at risk signs
        - Sagittal plane = subluxation (with separation of facet joints), retropulsion, toppling (severe retropulsion)
        - Coronal plane = Lateral translation

    - 2 out of 4 present should be fused
- ‼️ ⚠️What are the Stages of Pott paraplegia?
    - Tuli's 5 stages - based on motor then sensory involvement
        - Stage 1 = patient unaware of deficit
        - Stage 2 = **spasticity** with motor deficit but able to walk
        - Stage 3 = Bedridden **spasticity**
        - Stage 4 = Bedridden with severe **sensory loss.**
        - Stage 5 = 4 + bladder and bowel involvement/ **Flaccid**
- What is the reason for this sequence of stages?
    - Because compression starts anteriorly, first hit is the anterior corticospinal tract (same as mets)
    - Second hit - lateral spinothalamic tracts for pain
    - Third hit - posterior column deficit with sphincter deficit and complete sensory loss
- How can you classify TB spine?
    - Complicated vs uncomplicated
    - Complicated = presence of NID
- ‼️ What does TB chemotherapy consist off? Side effects?
    - Multi drug (4 or 5) treatment
    - Commonly - RIPES - Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrizanamide, Ethambutol, Streptomycin
    - R - body fluid get orange-red color
    - I - peripheral neuropathy
    - E - EYE - optic neuritis

- Mx for complicated TB?
    - No consensus on optimal treatment
    - Aware of MRC study which found chemo alone, debridement and radical debridement + fusion to have similar **functional** outcomes, **relapse** or late **onset** paraplegia but **less deformity in fusion**
    - Some authors advocate universal surgical intervention in all cases of paraplegia
    - I will consider the **Tuli middle path** regime where **chemotherapy is the fundamental treatment** but to consider surgery if lack of response, severe weakness, worsening neurology, instability and deformities (NID)
    - + bracing to prevent NID while giving chemotherapy
    - Neurology tends to improve as compared to acute traumatic cord injuries
- Surgical principles?
    - Goals = decompress, debride, maintain stability and prevent deformity
    - 1) Abscess drainage
    - 2) Debridement of infected material
    - 3) Debridement and fusion with or without stabilization
- What approach?
    - Previously commonly anterior approach as TB mainly affects anterior column
    - Nowadays, posterior procedures more commonly performed as it is able to achieve circumfrential decompression and deformity control with pedicle screws
    - Others– A+P

- Primary instrumentation for TB Spine?
    - Safe. **Oga 1993 et al.** shows that tubercle bacilli do not adhere to metal or film biofilm. So safe to instrument.
        - 11 patients with TB had primary instrumentation. No cases of persistence or recurrence infection after surgery.
        - Adherence properties of Mycobacterium TB to stainless steel was also investigated - found few bacteria adherent and a little thin biofilm observed as opposed to Staph Aureus which had a thick adherent biofilm

- ‼️ What are the causes of late onset neurological deficit after healed TB?
    - 3 reasons:
        - 1. **Reactivation** of TB
        - 2. Spinal atrophy and **syringomyelia**
        - 3. **Degeneration** at hyperlordotic segments below or above gibbus
