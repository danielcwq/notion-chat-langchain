### Child with MHE

![Untitled](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Untitled.png)

- The stem will be very vague “examine UL and LL”
- “I will first examine the **UL** - can you please remove your shirt?”
    - Remove shirt - look at scars in axilla, elbow, forearm
    
    ![Untitled](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - shortened forearm
    - bilateral radial head subluxations that appear to be cubitus varus
    - Limited in pronation/ supination
    - Check NV quickly - comment no involvement of NV
- “Proceed to examine LL”
    - Comment on **alignment** (valgus/ Varus)
    - **Gait** - short limb gait?
    - Multiple scars - could be from excision/ hemiepiphysiodesis/ osteotomies

        - Check Knee
- Complete my exam by:
    - Take a history from patient - AD, recent enlargement/ pain to suggest concerns for malignant change
    - Other complications

### Fibula Hemimelia

- Notice deformity, **missing toes,** pes planus, scars (dont panic may be quite a few from previous corrective surgery), LLD, pelvic obliquity, compensatory scoliosis
- “I am suspecting fibula hemimelia, I will go on to look for associated features”

    - Bend knee - acl, pcl, Check **collaterals** (genu valgum)
    - Patellar apprehension
    - **Ankle** range of motion - expect stiffness in ball and socket joint
    - Check LL neurovascular
- **upper** limbs: ulna club hand (radial deviation of forearm) with missing digits
- **Complete by** -

### Polio Look and Proceed [Not Pes Cavus]

- inspect (wasting, pes cavus, recurvatum). Look for walking aid.
    - Lift up shirt to check spine if pes cavus!
- walk patient - gait. Expect foot drop, hand to thigh, gluteus maximus gait
- offer Coleman block test to evaluate pes cavus
-if asked to examine pes cavus, examine all 4 muscles
- lie down
    - - check sensory loss (dermatomal method)
    - - motor power (ant tibialis and quads)
    - - examine vascular status [pre op]
    - - upper limb motor **deltoid** and **opponens**

### Constriction Band Syndrome

- Look for neurovascular, edema, proximal normal
- walk patient - function
- Lie down
- odema, nerves, vessels,

**May be distracted with a seemingly isolated problem

### Baker’s Cyst

- inspect when standing - note fullness in popliteal fossa/ varus deformity in OA
- Walk
- Sit and feel for crepitus

    - if Cyst - check adjacent joints to see if coming from there [SL joint, knee joint]
    - Check distal neurovascular status
- “My findings are consistent with a popliteal baker’s cyst, I would like to go on to examine rest of knee”

### Osteogenesis Imperfecta

- Patient sitting on a wheel chair
    - Note that patient is on chair
    - Appears to have **scoliosis** but I would like to remove the shirt and to evaluate from the back
    - Multiple **deformities** of the LL with bowing of femur tibia, UL
- “This patient appears to have features of osteogenesis imperfecta, I would like to go on to confirm my diagnosis”
    - **Eyes** - blue sclera
    - **Mouth** - Osteogenesis dentinogenesis
    - **UL -** deformities like anterior humeral bowing
    - **LL -** deformities like saber deformity of tibia, shepards crook/ lateral bowing of femur
    - **Scars -** for previous corrective surgeries if limbs are straight
    - **Beighton** score for hyperlaxity (type 1 collagen defect also)
- Complete exam - offer
    - **Neurological** exam - Scoliosis and basilar invagination
    - **CVM** asculatation - aortic valve defects
    

### Unilateral Foot Drop

“Examine this patient’s leg”. If examine gait, then start walking patient immediately”

- **Stand and look**
    - Ask to remove trousers (even if stem is examine gait)
    - At this point may not see anything as patient not walking
    - Look for scars at knee, buttocks and scars at the back
    - Look for wasting of muscles
    - Look for Foot deformities [Pes cavus/ Planus], claw toes [think CMT]
    - May see AFO or splints for foot drop/ walking aid
- **Walk the patient**
    - Foot drop gait with high steppage gait
    - Loss of first rocker with slapping of the feet
    - “I note that there is unilateral foot drop gait, will go on to evaluate for the level of involvement”
    - Comment on associated gait pattern
        - Hands on thigh, recurvatum in Polio
- **Return**
    - Special test - ask to **heel walk** to confirm inability to.
    - Check spine if you see there if foot drop. Because usually we don’t check spine scar normally when patient standing
        - Check for **spinal dysraphism**
        - Previous **instrumentation** for L4/5 radiculopathy
    - Do **trendelenberg test** - for glutes weakness in L5 radiculopathy

    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | L5 radiculo | NO | NO | NO |
    | Sciatic nerve | OK | NO | NO |
    | CPN | OK | OK | NO |
    - **Scar** - traumatic, iatrogenic, neoplastic, infection, disc herniation
    - **No scar** - traumatic (posterior hip dislocation), neoplastic (compression, neurologic (Hemiplegic CP), Polio
        - Systemic diseases such as **diabetes**, **vasculitis**, connective tissue, and **autoimmune** disease may also be the etiological cause.
        - In these circumstances, foot drop is almost always unilateral.

### Amputated Leg - BKA/ AKA/ Chopart

“Examine this patient’s leg”

- Look
    - Ask patient to remove pants to look at both lower limbs
    - “Patient has a BKA/ looks like a Midfoot amputation”
    - Report grossly the appearance, no scar no erythema
    - Note the other limb - presence (or absence) of diabetic dermopathy to suggest underlying cause of DM
- Walk [if this is forefoot amputation]
    - Look at gait
    - See if require any walking aid/ prosthesis

    - Once sit, pick up his prosthesis/ foot wear and mention a few things about the terminal device - is it or not energy storage
    - Examine **stump**
        - Mention scar, good healing
        - Presence of ulcer, pressure points
        - No features of Choke syndrome, venous congestion such as that of verucuous hyperplasia

### Rhizomelic Short Stature [Achondroplasia]

- looks short "want to measure height and plot on growth chart to confirm"
- comment proportionate or disproportionate (likely disproportionate)
- comment rhizomelic (likely) - proximal shorter than distal
    - 
- look for and comment on features of achondroplasia head to toe.

## Child on Wheel Chair

### Child with Cerebral palsy [Can Lie down]

- Look at patient AND around him
    - Note walking aids/ wheel chair/ Orthoses (GRAFO)
    - Observe if patient is sitting **with head control** (means this is not GMFCS 5)
- **Walk** - if possible
    - **Note the gait**
        - Diplegic = **Sutherlands** classification
        - Hemiplegic = **Winters** classification
    - Observe the use of walking aids
- **Sit** on edge of bed or remain on chair
    - Look closely at the neck, palpate for any VP shunt tube
    - Look at the chest for pacemaker like device - vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) for seizure control
        
        ![Untitled](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Look for any structural scoliosis from the back - comment it is **sweeping** or **double** curve [or ask patient lean forward]
    - **Lift up shirt** to look for scars of correction even if no scoliosis
    - Comment on **pelvic obliquity**
- Look at the **Upper limbs** while patient sitting
    - **Shoulder** internal rotation,
    - **Elbow** flexion deformity
        
        ![Untitled](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Hands - for hand in palm deformity
        
        ![Untitled](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Untitled%204.png)
        
- Lie down supine [”I will examine patient from distal to proximal joints”]
    - Ankle Joint / Foot
        - Check mobility of ankle joint
        - Look careful for scars for previous transfers
        - **Silverskoid** test - positive
    - Knee joint
        - Check for **knee contractures** ➔ prepare for thomas test with leg off side of bed
        - **Popliteal Angle** - **Hamstring**
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-08-26 at 12.02.15 PM.png](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Screenshot_2022-08-26_at_12.02.15_PM.png)
            
        - “Popliteal angle is x; Ideally, for each joint i am examining, I will examine the R1 which is the fast passive motion and R2 which is the slow passive motion to differentiate spasticity vs contracture, but due to time constraints, I will not do that now”
    - Hip joint
        - **Thomas** test
        - **Galeazzi** test - to evaluate for shortening at femur to suggest posterior dislocation
- Lie down prone
    - **Duncan Ely** test - rectus femoris tightness
        - **Duncan-Ely** test for rectus femoris tightness - Prone, knee gradually flexed and feel for spasticity. Elevation of ipsilateral hemipelvis = positive
            
            ![Untitled](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Untitled%205.png)
            
    - Craig’s test - expect femoral anteversion
    - **Phelp’s** test - test for gracilis contracture
        - Gracilis crosses both hip and knee joints; and relaxes when knee is flexed
        - Abduct the hip as far as possible
        - Flex both knees - this shortens the gracilis (i.e. more relaxed)
        - Then try to abduct hip further.
            - If it is possible to abduct more ➔ positive test. (Gracilis is the one causing adduction contraction)
            - If not possible to abduct more ➔ negative test. (Even relaxing gracilis does not lead to increase abduction)
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-08-26 at 11.59.45 AM.png](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Screenshot_2022-08-26_at_11.59.45_AM.png)

    - Offer to do **Staheli** test (practically difficult)
        - Practically same test for hip flexion deformity as Thomas test, just opposite
        - Prone, pelvis at edge and stabilised, angle between horizontal line and thigh is degree of hip flexion contracture [Normal 10-20 °]
        
        ![Untitled](Look%20and%20Proceed%20Cases%20309b69086c754af0af77fb35ca6f6d81/Untitled%206.png)
        
- Examination on Chair
    - Hip Ideally to do **Thomas** test for FFD
    - Gross **Galeazzi** - looking at the level of the patella, appears symmetrical, does not indicate gross posterior hip dislocation, unless both are affected
    - **Popliteal Angle** - usually done prone with hip in 90 degrees - current in this position
    - **Phelp test** while sitting
    - Ideally to do duncan ely test, Craig’s test
- Complete my exam with
    - Full neurological exam
    - Assessing the patient’s function in his ADL
