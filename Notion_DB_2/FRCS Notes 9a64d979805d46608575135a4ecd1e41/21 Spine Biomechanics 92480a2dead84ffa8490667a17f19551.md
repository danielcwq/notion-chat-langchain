    - PI = SS + PT
    - **Pelvic incidence**
        - Is an anatomical constant
        - Angle between Line from Center of Head to Mid point of S1 and Perpendicular line from Mid point of sacrum
    - **Pelvic tilt** = Angle between Line from Center of head to mid point of S1 and vertical line from center of head
    - **Sacral slope** = Angle between Line along S1 and horizontal line
- ‼️ What is spinal stability?
    - Defined by Panjabi and White in 1990 as the ability for the spine to limit **displacement** to prevent pain, neurology or deformity. **Under physiological loads**
    - Using 3 systems
- What is the FSU? Definition?
    - It is the **smallest physiological motion unit** of the spine to **exhibit biomechanical characteristics similar to those of the entire spine**
    - The smallest unit is that of the Functional Spinal Unit consists of 2 VB, ligaments, 1 disc, facet jts. "3 joint complex"
    - **DOES** NOT contain muscles
- What maintains the spinal stability?
    - **Active** = muscle
    - **Passive** = Ligaments
    - **Neural** = nerves, proprioception
- ‼️ Can you describe Spinal stability by a graph?
    - Can be described with a **load-displacement curve** and visualized in a ball in bowl diagram

    - **Neutral** zone – active and neural involved
    - **Elastic** zone – passive involved = full ROM
- How do you describe aging and spine stability?
    - As one gets older, passive systems compensate with osteophytes and facet joint hypertrophy and thus elastic zone/ full ROM is reduced (Wine glass from bowl)

- How do you describe back pain and the use of physio/ fusion in terms of spine stability?
    - Understood by the pain free zone.
        - If pain free zone is within NZ, then pain outside of pain free zone
        - If pain free is outside of NZ, then no pain unless stressed above the NZ

    - (A) Normal - If pain free zone is outside of Neutral zone, then patient will not have pain
    - (B) **Elastic zone increases in trauma or degeneration** when there is impairment of the passive system (damage to ligaments/ fractures). **Neutral zone** also increases but not by as much due to concomittant muscle injury. If pain free zone is within neutral zone, then patient will have pain out of the pain free zone
        - Physio aims to strengthen the muscles to bring the neutral zone smaller to within pain free zone (B to A)
    - (C) Fusion surgery limits the entire elastic zone to within the pain free zone
- ‼️ What are the radiological signs of instability?
    - C spine 3.5mm/ 11
    - T spine 2.5mm/ 11
    - Lumbar spine 4.5mm/ 11
- Which joint moves the most in the Cervical spine?

    - 50% of neck flexion extension is at OC joint (OC flex)
    - 50% of neck rotation is at C1/C2 Joint (AA Rotates)
    - 60% of lateral bending by Subaxial spine, 50% of rotation and 50% of neck flexion/ extension
- ‼️ What is the facet joint orientation and the resultant movement pattern?

    - **Saggital** - becomes steeper from C-spine to Lumbar spine - 45 ° to 90 ° = Corresponds to **reduced rotation ability**
    - **Axial** - From neutral to Facing out 20 ° to facing in 45 °
- Which transverse foramen does Vertebral artery travel in?
    - C1 to C6 but not C7

- Draw FBA of Lumbar spine to explain why one need to squats to carry things?
    - The nearer the weight is to the body, the shorter the moment arm of BW and the weight, the less compressive force across the disc
        
        ![Untitled](21%20Spine%20Biomechanics%2092480a2dead84ffa8490667a17f19551/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - From a functional unit POV, there is a tension force provided by the muscles posteriorly, resulting in a shear force across the disc.

    - 
- What position is the spine under the most load?
    - **Sitting with the load in the hands** is the highest load.
    - Due to long lever arm to the disc
    - Fulcrum is at the ALL, counter force is the **paraspinal** muscles

### Sagittal Alignment of Spine

- What is the sagittal alignment of spine in neonates?
    - Neonates normally has gentle convex curve posteriorly along its entire length
    - Once have head control → secondary lordotic curve in C spine
    - Once ambulate → lordotic curve develop in Lumbar spine
- What gives this alignment?
    - Wedging of **bones** in thoracic and sacral curves
    - Wedging of **discs** causes lumbar and cervical curves
- ‼️ What is the normal values of sagittal alignment?
    - **30/60/60**
    - Cervical spine **20-40** deg
    - Thoracic spine **35** deg
    - Lumbar spine **60** °
- How do you evaluate sagital alingment?
    - Sagittal vertical axis (SVA) with 7 plumbline
    - It should posterior through posterosuperior corner of S1 vertebral body within **5mm**
