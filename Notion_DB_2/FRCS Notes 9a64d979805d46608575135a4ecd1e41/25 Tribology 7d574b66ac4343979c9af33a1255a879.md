### FRICTION

- What is friction?
    - **Resistance** to sliding motion between 2 bodies in contact
- What is roughness?
    - **Roughness** = average height of asperities;
        - Expressed as mean surface roughness (Ra)
    - Sample Roughnesses
        - Cartilage 1-6
        - Polished stem 0.01-0.03
        - Matt stem 0.7 - 1.3
    - Samples of Coefficients of friction
        - Articular cartilage of knee 0.005 - 0.02
        - MoP 0.02
- ‼️ What is coefficient of friction?
    - It is expressed as an equation as **frictional force** over **Load**

    - As such, it is influenced by the frictional forces between the 2 joint surface and the load across it
    - Frictional forces can be reduced by efficient lubrication and a low surface roughness
- How does the native joint achieve a low frictional coefficient?
    - Conformity of the joint
    - Cartilage properties - very smooth and low roughness
    - Lubrication with fluid film/ boundary

### WEAR

- What are the 4 ***modes*** of wear?
    - **MCKELLOP** modes of wear
    
    ![Untitled](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Untitled.png)
    
    - Mode 1 = between two 1° surface - normal wear
    - Mode 2 = Between 1° and 2° surface e.g. **stripe wear,**
    - Mode 3 = interposed FB
    - Mode 4 = 2 non bearing surfaces. e.g. **back side wear,** **trunnion wear**
- What are the 3 ***mechanisms*** of wear?
    - **Abrasive** Wear - 2 kinds
        - Soft material scratched by hard material asperites
        - Third body wear
    - **Adhesive** wear - junction formed between 2 surfaces
    - **Fatigue** wear (aka delamination) as described with a S-n curve
        - **Cyclical loading** causing accumulation of microdamage
- How do you measure wear?
    - Can be done with “Radiostereometric Analysis”
    - **Linear** wear (mm/year)
    - **Volumetric** wear (mm3/year)
- What is RadioStereometric Analysis (RSA)?
    - The use of 2 XR beams perpendicular to one another to localize the position of an object in space

    - Initially the technnology required Tantalum markers inserted into bone to take reference from
    - Eventually, special markers are placed on the implant
    - More recently, no need markers and uses landmarks on shoulder and tip of implant.

- Picture of broken implant/ cement mantle. Explain why this fails?
    - This occurs because bony union has not been achieved and the implant has undergone too many cycles at a stress higher than the endurance limit.
    - This is **fatigue failure aka delamination**, can be explained in a S-n curve.
    - Y-axis is stress
    - X-axis is the n, number of cycles
        
        ![Untitled](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - **Endurance** limit aka **fatigue** limit = **stress** level below which a specimen can withstand cyclic stress indefinitely without experiencing fatigue failure **(10 million cycles)**
    - So in this case, the implant underwent **cyclic stresses** is applied **below the yield point**, **yet above the endurance limit** resulting in fatigue failure.
- What is a stress riser?
    - A change in **contour** that **increases the concentration of stresses**, thus, **increasing the risk of fatigue failure**
- How do we balance the size of the interlocking screw or lag screw?
    - Due to the lesser material at the interlocking or lag screws, there is a stress riser there.
    - Also the uniformity of the cylinder is disrupted by 2 holes, resulting in weakness in that area
    - However, this is balanced with the need for an appropriately sized interlocking screw to confer rotational stability

- What is the difference between aseptic loosening vs osteolysis?
    - Some literature use these terms interchangeably, but osteolysis is actually a form of aseptic loosening
    - Loosening can be septic vs aseptic loosening
    - Osteolysis is a form of aseptic loosening, specifically due to PE particles leading to **bone resorption**
    - Other forms of aseptic loosening can be due to **inadequate initialy fixation or mechanical loss of fixation over time**
- What is the **pathogenesis of Osteolysis**? What is effective joint space?
    - 1. PE or other wear particles debris produced (0.1-10micrometer) e.g. cement that is released
    - 2. Activate macrophages ➔ Leads to inflammation and synovitis ➔ produce mediators e.g. **Interleukin -1, TNF-alpha**
    - 3. These activate **osteoblasts** which then activate osteoclasts by the release of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta)
    - 4. Inflammation spreads by entering **effective joint space** (includes all periprosthetic regions that are ***accessible*** to joint fluid and thus particulate debris; going by path of least resistance) ➔
    - 5. Progressive implant loosening
- What size must PE particles be to incite osteolysis?
    - 0.1 - 10 micrometer. Most potent being 1 micrometer
    - If smaller than this ➔ do not stimulate macrophages
    - if larger than 10micrometer ➔ do not get phagocytosed
- How to reduce wear practically in Arthroplasty?
    - Divided into technical, manufacturing factors
    - **Patient factors** - activity, age, weight
    - **Technical** - No loose bodies, good alignment (avoid excessive inclination)
    - **Implant factors -** head size, material bearing choice, modularity
- How does cup positioning affect lubrication and wear?
    - Increased inclination will affect fluid entrainment (reason why high acetabular index is a risk factor for MOM ARMD)

    ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 9.01.28 AM.png](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_9.01.28_AM.png)
    
- How to reduce effective joint space?
    - Acetabulum side:
        - Theoretically acetabular shells without screw holes
        - Reduce use of screws in acetabulum
    - Stem side:
        - For cemented - Taper slip stems that subsides into cetralizer can block off potential space
        - For cementless - circumfrential proximal coated stem can seal off diaphyseal component of femoral canel from effective joint space.
- What is **“particle disease”**?
    - This term was put forth by William Harris in 1994.
    - THen, there was recognition of osteolysis but much of it was attributed to the use of cement, thus it was termed cement disease, which led to the use of cementless implants
    - However, osteolysis was still seen in cementless implants, thus, William proposed a new term “particle disease” as opposed to “cement disease” to attribute the cause of osteolysis to other particles such as PE, metal or cement particles.

### POLYETHYLENE

- What is polyethylene?
    - A linear polymer of ethylene gas - (C2H4)
    - (C2H4)n
        
        ![Untitled](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Untitled%204.png)
        
- What is the name of the process by which PE is made?
    - The manufacture of polyethylene is by the **Ziegler process** to transform ethylene gas into **powder form**
    - Gas it polymerized in a low temperature, low pressure environment to produce UHMWPE fine powder
- **1. How is PE manufactured?**
    - There are 4 main ways - ram bar extrusion, Sheet compression moulding, hot isostatic pressing and direct compression moulding; of which, Direct compression is the best
    - DCM involves direct compression molding from PE powder and there is no secondary machining of the bearing surface. Thus, lower susceptibility to fatigue crack formation. But it is slower and more expensive
    - Other types
        - Ram bar extrusion - powder becomes a PE bar and then secondarily machined
        - Sheet compression - made into a large sheet, then machined
- Why are other forms of manufacturing not as good?
    - The need for secondary machining leads to microscopic grooves and shreds on the bearing surface ➔ more susceptible to failure.
    - One of the major advantages of direct compression moulding is that the surface of the moulded polyethylene insert is smooth, lacking machine marks or groove.
- **2. How is PE Sterilized?**
    - 3 main ways - ethylene oxide gas, gas plasma or gamma irradiation
        - **Gamma irradiation** - most common. Dosage is **(2.5-4Mrad)**.
        - **EO gas** - lengthy process 40 hours, no free radicals.
        - **Gas plasma** - plasma from vaporized hydrogen peroxide - faster 4 hours
- What happens when PE is irradiated?
    - Irradiation breaks some of the covalent bonds and free radicals are generated = "Chain Scisson". The PE then can react in 3 ways
    - 1. **Recombination**/ rebonding
    - 2. **Cross linking**
    - 3. **Free Radical oxidation** ➔ will reduce mechanical properties (so thus, do under vacuum)
- 3. How is Cross linking done?
    - Involves bombarding high dose gamma irradiation **(5-15mRad)** that causes chain scission
    - The PE than either - rebond, oxidize or cross link
    - We prevent free radical oxidation by 3 ways
- **How To prevent free radical oxidation?** 3 ways
    - 1. Do under vacuum
    - 2. Annealing which is heating to below the melting point OR remelting [remelting affects mechanical properties but can remove all free radicals. Annealing removes some but not all free radicals but retain mechanical properties!]
    - 3. Vitamin E
- 1st gen vs 2nd gen XLPE?
    - **1st gen** is Annealing or remelting once
    - **2nd gen** is either vitamin E or repeated cycles of annealing and irradiation
- 4. Packaging
    - Good packaging material with **low diffusion capability** ➔ reduce oxidation
    - Vacuum
    - Shelf life
- What are the 2 states of UHMWPE?
    - Crystalline and Amorphous phase
        - Cross linking is in amophorphous phase.
        - Crystaline phase provides **mechanical strength**. Optimal crystalinity is between 45-65%
    - Optimal Crystallinity is about 45-65%
- What are the clinical properties of XLPE vs normal PE?
    - Compared to standard PE, HXLPE has:
        - Better wear resistance.
        - The PE particles tend to be smaller in size and produce less osteolytic reaction.
        - There is generally a decreased number of particles generated.
    - Disadvantages include:
        - Decreased tensile strength – the pulling force to break.
        - Decreased fatigue strength – the maximum cyclic stress the material can withstand.
        - Decreased fracture toughness – the force to propagate a crack. Decreased ductility – elongation without fracture.
    - XLPE = it has better wear resistance however, propensity to undergo fatigue wear
- What is the minimal PE thickness in THR?
    - Conventional PE - 8mm
    - HXLPE - about 5mm
- Why not use XLPE in TKR?
    - Although the benefit of highly cross-linked PE in reducing wear rates in THA have been confirmed, there are concerns with its use in TKA.
    - 1. Different material properties
        - These include reduced strength, fatigue resistance and fracture toughness due to additional irradiation and thermal treatment.
    - 2. **Different types of articulation** in THR vs TKR
        - THA articulation occurs mostly as a **sliding** motion in a ball-and-socket joint, while TKA articulation can occur as **rolling**, **sliding** and **rotating**.
    - 3. The mechanism of wear between these two joints is different.
        - THA wear is mostly due to micro-adhesion and abrasion.
        - TKA wear can be due to fatigue failure with delamination and pitting.
    - HOWEVER, australian registry shows lower revision rates with XLPE
        
        ![Untitled](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - More ppl using XLPE now
        
        ![Untitled](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Untitled%206.png)
        
- What increases risk of catastrophic PE failure in TKR?
    - 1) PE thickness - < 8mm
    - 2) articular surface design - flat and non conforming ➔ increasing contact stresses,
    - 3) knee kinematics
    - 4) PE manufacture - poor manufacturing
    - 5) PE sterilization
    - 6) surgical technique - poor alignment

### LUBRICATION

- What determines the surface roughness?
    - It is the average height of the asperities
- What is **lambda ratio**? What does it determine?
    - Lambda Ratio is ratio between **Fluid film thickness** to **surface roughness**
    - Ratio of 3 = FF ; Ratio of 1 = Boundary
- Why not have a Lambda ratio of 10? As high as possible?
    - Although there is no contact, there is high **internal friction** within the fluid itself.
- ‼️ Types of lubrication?
    - Fluid Film (6 theories)
        - Hydrodynamic = no contact; high speeds e.g. swing
        - ElastoHD = **elastic deformation** of surface increase SA
        - MicroElastoHD = **Asperites** (micro) elastic deformation to smoothen
        - Squeeze Film = **Molecules squeezed**; heel strike phase
        - Boosted = **water** pushed out into cartilage/ meniscus sponge phenomenon
        - Weeping = **Water + molecules** pushed out into cartilage
            
            ![Untitled](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Untitled%207.png)
            
    - Boundary = **Molecular** thickness of fluid; standing
- Lubrication in native joint in reference to Gait?
    - **Swing** = moving fast = hydrodynamic
    - **Heel strike** = from moving fast to sudden loading = Sqeeuze film
    - **Stance** = weight on joint but moving = microelastichydrodynamic
    - **Prolonged stance** = Boundary
    - It can be described in the form of a **Stribeck** curve
        
        ![Untitled](25%20Tribology%207d574b66ac4343979c9af33a1255a879/Untitled%208.png)
        
        - Y axis - friction coefficient.
        - X-axis - mV/P = fluid viscosity, speed, load
        - Low speed and high load produces **boundary** lubrication = prolonged stance
        - As speed and velocity increases and load at the interface reduces ➔ **Hydrodynamic** lubrication = Swing phase
        - As speed increases, friction also increase at the end of the curve due to **fluid drag**. Higher speed results in thicker fluid film, increasing fluid drag on moving surfaces.
- What is the most predominant lubrication in native joints?
    - Elastohydrodynamic lubrication
- What is the predominant lubrication in Prosthetic joints? How about MOM? or COC?
    - Pseudosynovial fluid thus lubrication states are more complex
    - **Boundary** lubrication predominates
    - MOM - some HD lubrication on movement depending on angular velocity
- ⚠️ What is wettability?
    - Wettablility = relative affinity of lubrication for another material
    - Defined by the Contact angle (**tetha** angle) which is lower in high wettability

### CORROSION

- What is corrosion?
    - unwanted dissolution of metal in a solution due to oxidation reactions at anode with loss of electrons to cathode
- What are the types of corrosion?
    - There is **generalized vs localised** corrosion
    - (G) **Galvanic** = 2 dissimilar metals electrically coupled together
    - (L) **Pitting** Corrosion = small pits of holes formed with depassivation of a small area resulting in localised galvanic corrosion
    - (L) **Crevice** Corrosion = exchange of fluid is limited in a small crevice ➔ localised galvanic currents
    - (L) **Fretting** Corrosion = synergistic combination of wear and crevice ➔ micro motion disrupts passive oxide layer ➔ expose surface for galvanic currents AND loose bodies also lead to wear.
    - (L) **Stress Corrosion** = **fatigue** wear in corrosive environment accelerates corrosion
