### Knee Dislocation

![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled.png)

- ‼️ Key clinical findings? Implications?
    - "Pucker Sign" = implies a POSTEROLATERAL ROTATORY dislocation with buttonholing of Medial femoral condyle through the VMO
        - Implies difficult close reduction, will require open reduction. Approach?
        - Likely direct incision (anteromedial approach) over pucker to reduce

    - COMPARTMENT SYNDROME
    - NEUROVASCULAR
- Classification of knee dislocation?
    - **Kennedy** = by TIBIAL direction
        - Anterior - most common 40% [ Anterior a/w popliteal vessel traction injury, posterior a/w complete rupture of popliteal artery]
        
        ![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - **Schenk Classification** = by injured structure
        
        ![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - KD1 = ACL or PCL only
        - KD 2 = ACL and PCL
        - KD 3 = ACL and PCL + one collateral
        - KD 4 = all 4
        - KD 5 = + fracture
- ‼️ Why is popliteal artery so easily injured?

    - Tethered at 3 areas
    - 1. Adductor hiatus
    - 2. Popliteal fossa
    - 3. Soleus Arch
- What other associated injuries?
    - Common peroneal nerve - 25%
    - Prognosis is poor - recovery only 50%
- ⚠️ Acute Management and monitoring?
    - Closed KIV open reduction KIV Ex fix
        - Pins away from future graft tunnels 10cm above and below JL)
    - **Monitor ABPI** for > 0.9
        - if ABPI < 0.9 - possible intima injury
            - THis is based on the study by **William mills et al.** in JOT 2002. Found that out of 38 patients, 11 had an ABPI < 0.9 and all 11 had arterial injury requiring surgical treatment. Remaining 27 patients did not have vascular injury detectable by serial PE or duplex US.
        - 3 scenarios:
        
        ![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled%205.png)
        
        - Pulse +, ABPI + = observe, STILL NEED ANGIO (Controversial)
        - Pulse +, ABPI - = **CT angio**
        - Pulse - = Vascular referral kiv Ex Fix, KIV shunting vascular repair KIV **Prophylactic Fasciotomy**
        - ABPI.pdf
- Do all patients need an arteriogram in knee dislocation?
    - **Controversial**
    - “I will discuss with my vascular colleagues and to monitor with serial PE and ABPI for at least 48 hours in these patients.:
    - Study by **James Stannard et al. JBJS 2004** of 138 knees with 10 having abnormal PE findings. 9 of them flow limiting popliteal artery damage. (i.e. 1 false positive)
    - Paper concluded that selective arteriography based on serial PE is a safe and prudent policy. Strong correlation between results of PE and need for arteriography. Increased vigilance justified for patients with KF-4 dislocation
    - Other study by **Weinberg et al. a**lso found that a combination of a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse conbined with an ABPI of > 0.9 was 100% sensitive  for ruling out vascular injury
    - KD 4 dislocation - should serial PE for at least 48 hours
    
    [](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15118031/)
    
- When should you do CT angiogram?
    - **History of ischemia** at any point (before or after reduction)- weak pulses/ loss of CRT
    - **ABPI < 0.9**

- Popliteal Fossa Approach (to Popliteal Artery)
    - P - prone
    - I - gently curved S-shaped incision with medial limb distally (SPN is lateral) at biceps muscle)
    
    ![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - S - Identify the **short saphenous vein and medial sural cutaneous nerve** (from the tibial nerve) ➔ Trace this into the apex of the popliteal Fossa
    - At the apex, this is where the CPN separates from the tibial nerve.
    - From the tibial nerve, the popliteal artery and vein (Vein medial to artery) lies deep and medial to the tibial nerve
    - incise popliteal fascia proximally, following the tibial nerve ➔ CPN should split from the tibial berve at the apex of the incision
    
    ![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - Structures - **Artery is deepest** ➔ Vein ➔ Nerve (AVN; also from medial to lateral)
    - Deep dissection ➔ Detach tendinous origin of the medial an lateral head of gastrocnemius
- ‼️ ⚠️ What if vascular injury? [Bana 314]
    - Supine and Shunt First
    - Supine first - apply lateral femoral pins and anteromedial tibial pins
    - Turn prone - for repair by vascular surgeons
    - Turn supine again - place rods to pins
    - Turn prone again - vascular anastamoses
    - **Concurrent faciotomies to pre-empt revascularization injury**

- Knee Dislocation - Definitive management for? Outcomes?
    - No consensus regarding single stage vs staged; early vs delayed
    - Reference from Mook et al. recommending staged procedure
    - **1st stage** = Extra-articular collateral ligament repair vs recon
        - Timing < 3 weeks
        - Repair **LCL/ PLC**
        - **MCL** can heal w bracing ➔ reassess 6/52 time before 2nd stage to decide surgery [Unless, MCL -stener type lesion or MCL flipped into joint]
        - **Jack’s brace** to allow PCL to heal
    - **2nd stage** = ACL and KIV PCL
        - Timing = 6-8 weeks
        - Duration is for 2 reasons
            - allows capsular healing to prevent extravasation during arthroscopy
            - Prevent arthrofibrosis.
    - Mook et al. **Staged has Higher % of subjective excellent scores, better ROM preservation**
- What is your timing for surgery if there is a vascular repair done?
    - Delay for 6 months, to allow vessel repair to mature.
- 50% will have permanent nerve palsy and foot drop. Management of chronic foot drop?
    - Nerve grafting within 6 months
    - Tendon transfer if > 6 months = **Posterior tibialis tendon transfer**

### Patella Fractures

- Role in contralateral XR?
    - Bipartite patella 50% bilateral – classically in superolateral position
- Mx = SIMPLE TRANSVERSE: How will you fix this fracture?
    - Tension band wire
    - Supine, tourniquet, side support
    - Midline incision, expose fracture site, reduce temp K-wires
    - Figure 11 and 8 TBW
    - Ensure reduction with mini arthrotomy on medial side
    - Post op - Knee brace, allow PROM 0-30, when walking locked in extension, follow up with XR
- **What is the principle behind tension band wire?
    
    [31. Fracture Fixation Principles](31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e.md) 
    
- Mx = COMMINUTED?
    - Cerclage wiring
- Mx = Very distal?
    - Intraosseous suture
- If not reconstructuble?
    - Patellectomy
- How does Patellectomy affect knee function?
    - 2 effects:
    - 1. Reduced Quadriceps strength
        - Excision of patella reduces quadriceps strength by 20%
        - Due to reduced moment arm of the patellar tendon, especially when flexed as the distance further reduces as the tendon goes into the trochlea
        - 
        
        ![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - 2. Increased instability
        
        ![Untitled](Knee%20Dislocation%20Patella%20Fractures%2084c78b707fdf4c5faf6c811d8ef6cc6a/Untitled%209.png)
        
        - Presence of Patella directs the patellar tendon to be parallel to the PCL, reinforcing the PCL function
        - After patellectomy, patellar tendon is no longer parallel
        - Over time, increases stresses across the PCL and posterior capsule causes them to be stretched ➔ unreliable ➔ So do PS implant

- What are the considerations for future TKR in patient with patellectomy?
    - **Standard PS knee** without reconstruction due to unpredictable PCL function (effects of patellectomy) Outcomes?
        - Intact patella has superior outcomes. Arc of flexion less, complication rates (instability, infection)
        - Infection higher may be due to subtle instability
    - **OR recontruct patellar** with femoral condyle (when doing distal femur cut), fresh frozen allograft
