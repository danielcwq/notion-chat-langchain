Status: Not started
Studies: Revised x 1
Topic: Knee

- Approach to painful TKR?
    - Need to exclude extra-articular pain first, then TRO septic arthritis then consider the rest
    - **Extra-articular** pain - Hip, spine radiculopathy and stenosis, Varicose vein, peripehral arterial disease (these may be present right after the op)
- Usually in which side is the loosening?
    - Tibia > Femoral > Patella
- What is catastrophic wear?
    - It is premature failure of implant due to **macroscopic** wear, presenting with large effusion and pain
    - Perfect storm scenario - Thin PE of < 8mm, flat PE, Poor manufacture technique
- ‼️ How will you revise this knee? #📜
    - Complex procedure PreOp, Intra-op, Post op
    - Pre Op
        - Template
        - Know implants, prepare explant tools
        - Stand by stem, constrained implants
    - Intraop
        - “The General principles of revision is **EEE, RRR**
        - **E**xposure - Incisons to use most lateral if multiple present. Plan for extensile maneuvers
        - **E**xplantation
        - **E**xamine **bone** loss with AORI, Contained/uncontained, and Integrity of **collaterals** ➔ need for higher constraint implant
        - **R**econstruct bone loss
        - **R**eplace appropriately by Zonal concept
    - Post Op Rehabilitation
- What is the AORI classification?

    - Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute
    - Type 1 = < 5mm, **Contained** defects
    - Type 2 = > 5mm (A or B is uni or bi- condylar involved), **uncontained** defects
    - Type 3 = deficient metaphysis
- What does contained vs uncontained defects mean? What are the implications?
    - Contained = Presence of cortical rim
    - If uncontained, will need cortical support and cement alone will be insufficient as it will escape. Will require sleeves and cones
- How do you reconstruct the bone loss?
    - Type 1 = Cement +/- screw augmentation
    - Type 2 = bone graft, metal augments (e.g. blocks)

    - Type 3 = cones, sleeves, megaprosthesis
- Revision TKR - What is the zonal concept?
    - Zonal concept by **Morgan-Jones** et al. JBJS 2015 – need at least 2 zones of fixation
    - Zone 1 = joint surface
    - Zone 2 = Metaphysis (cones and augments)
    - Zone 3 = diaphysis (stems)
- What is the difference between sleeve and cones?
    - Sleeves
        - Sleeves are engaged to tibia implant via morse taper (prepared at side table)
        - Has **multiple steps** to improve engagement
        - Prepared through broaching and sequential rasping
    - Cones
        - Cones are cemented to each other i.e. cone is placed in the defect first, then stem is cemented into the cone
        - Cone is made of trabeculae metal on the outside so that bony ingrowth can occur

- What is the difference between wedge and blocks?
    - These are forms of zone 1 fixation
    - Controversial if wedge or block is better
    - Wedge allows for less bone resection than blocks
    - However, some studies show that blocks are more biomechanically more stable and technically easier to perform.
    
    [Management of Tibial Bony Defect with Metal Block in Primary Total Knee Replacement Arthroplasty](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597846/#B27)
    
- What are the options of managing zone 1 defects?
    - Insertion of **thicker PE after bony resection** extending distal to deficient area
        - (-) Can compromise strength of cancellous bone in proximal tibia; Also, due to narrower tibia distally, smaller tibia component has to be used, may need to mis match
    - Bone **cement with or without screw** reinforcement
        - Cement alone ok for < 5mm
        - Screw reinforcement suggested if > 5mm
    - **Bone grafting**
    - Metal **wedge or block** - suitable for < 2cm bone defects
    - **Custom** made components
