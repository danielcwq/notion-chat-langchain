- ‼️ What is the embrylogy of the spine?
    - Begins at week 4
    - 3 key tissue - Sclerotome cells, Notochord, Intersegmental mesenchyme
        - Sclerotome cells ➔ Vertebral body
        - Notochord ➔ NP
        - Mesenchymal cells ➔ Annulus fibrosis
        - Neural tube ➔ becomes the spinal cord
        - Neural crest ➔ becomes pia mater and the peripheral nervous system

- What tumor arises from error in embryology?
    - Notochord remnants ➔ Chordoma
- ‼️ DRAW Disc and collagen arrangement
    - Draw and label 3 structures

    - 1. Annulus fibrosus – lamellated **type 1** collagen criss crossing 30 deg to horizontal - 15-25 layers each layer is opposite in direction.
    - 2. Nucleus pulposus – gel-like **type 2** collagen, greater water content.
        - Contains high density of glycosaminoglycan chains that attract high water content (doonan Osmotic pressure)
    - 3. End plates = **1mm** thick junction between annulus and VM
        - End plate against the AF composed of collagen fibers continuous with disc
        - End plate against VB is hyaline cartilage, less adherent, susceptible to shear forces
- Why this arrangement of collagen?
    - Allows disc to resist torsional, axial and tensile loads
- Function of the end plate?
    - To act as a semipermeable membrane allowing nutrients and metabolites to diffuse into the disc from the capillary blood of the vertebral body and to allow waste products to diffuse out.

- Innervation of the disc?

    - Dorsal Ramus gives rise to **medial branch** supplying facet joins
    - Ventral Ramus gives rise to:
        - 1. **Sinuvertebral** nerve (from ventral ramus) ➔ posterior annulus, Dura, PLL
        - 2. **Gray ramus Communicans** (from sympathetic ganglion)➔ anterior annulus, ALL
    - Only the **outer third** of a healthy annulus is innervted. Inner two-thirds is completely avascular and aneural

- Nutrition of disc?
    - Completely Avascular
    - Nutrition reaches NP by diffusion through end plate
- Why is the nucleus pulposus viscoelastic?
    - **Hydrostatic** pressure in interstitial fluid
    - **Doonan** osmotic Pressure (proteoglycans retaining water)
    - Loose **framework of collagen- proteoglycan** matrix
- Function of the Disc?
    - Nucleus Pulposus = maintain vertebral height, resist compression
    - Annulus Fibrosus = distributes loads via **hoop stresses** by converting compressive force to radial forces.
    - AF has the **highest tensile stress** while NP has the highest **compressive stress**

- What is the **Kirkaldy Wallis Degenerative** cascade?
    - 1. **Dysfunctional** phase (4 things)  =
        
        [tear, dehydration, conversion, stiffening]
        
        - **tears** of annulus,
        - disc **dehydration** [DDD, spinal stenosis].
        - There is **conversion** of type 2 collagen to type 1 fibrocartillage ➔ **stiffening** of the Nucleus pulposus
    - 2. **Instability** - [spondylolisthesis]
    - 3. **Restabilization** = osteophyte formation, buckling of ligamentum flavum
- Genetics of disc degeneration?
    - Multifactorial but 2 genes recently found to be contributing
    - Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene and COL 9A2 Gene
