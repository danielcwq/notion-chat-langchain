### PolyTrauma

![Untitled](Polytrauma%20Open%20Fractures%20Mangled%20Limbs%20Skin%20Recon%207941953ae9204e46b5b898b5997e85fb/Untitled.png)

- What is this chart?
    - This is a chart of the systemic inflammatory response of the body to trauma
    - **First Hit** = Traumatic injuries lead to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome **(SIRS**) followed by a period of recovery mediated by a **counter-regulatory anti-inflammatory response** (**CARS**).
    - Second Hit = Surgery may represent a second hit. ” The impact of surgery on the patient biological reserve depends on its type and timing
    - Understanding this chart led to the development of DCO, as opposed to ETC.
- What is SIRS?
    - Immune response mounted by body in response to trauma
    - It is defined by **having 2 or more of -** **Tacchycardia**, Low **PaCO2**, High or low **WBC**, High or low **Temperature**
    - If it crosses a certain threshold, patient may develop Acute Respiratory Syndroms (**ARDS**) and Multi Organ dysfunction syndrome (**MODS**)
- What are the inflammatory markers released?
    - Interleukin 1, 6, 8, 10 and TNF-alpha
- What is the lethal triad?
    - Hypothermia, Hypercoagulopathy, Metabolic Acidosis
        
        ![Untitled](Polytrauma%20Open%20Fractures%20Mangled%20Limbs%20Skin%20Recon%207941953ae9204e46b5b898b5997e85fb/Untitled%201.png)
        
- What is ETC?
    - It means "Early total care" which advocated early definitive management of ALL fractures ➔ but this is found to affect the second hit phenomenon
- What is DCO?
    - Damage control orthopaedics was a **term coined by the US Navy in reference to keep a badly damanged ship afloat**
    - DCO is the providing **temporary stabilization** with Ex fix of long bone and pelvic fractures with the aim of reducing major pain, fat emboli, SIRS, **lethal triad** and the **second hit phenomenon.**
    - It is as opposed to "Early Total Care"
    - Most literature on DCO was on femoral shaft fractures. Pape et al. suggested that femoral shaft fracture patients can be classfied into **stable, borderline, unstable and extremis** groups based on several markers of shock, coagulation, temperature and soft tissue injuries

- What is EAC?
    - However, recently Vallier proposed a new approach to poly trauma known as Early Appropriate Care
    - It reccomends definitive management of mechanically unstable fractures within 36 hours of injury as long as patient has demonstrated repsonse to resuscitation based on 3 biochemical markers.
        - Lactate **< 4**
        - pH **> 7.25**
        - Base Excess **> -5.5mmool/L**
            
            ![Untitled](Polytrauma%20Open%20Fractures%20Mangled%20Limbs%20Skin%20Recon%207941953ae9204e46b5b898b5997e85fb/Untitled%203.png)
            
    - If persistently deranged, a DCO strategy is used.

- What is this chart?
    - This is an ebb and flow chart of **metabolic response** to injury which has 3 phases
    - 1. **Ebb** phase = decreased metabolic rate in **early shock** - first hours after injury [24-48 hours]
    - 2. **Flow** phase = **catabolic** phase [2-7 days]
        - Provides **compensating response** to the initial trauma and volume replacement, except most minor injuries
        - The **increased body oxygen consumption** and metabolic rate are among these responses.
    - 3. **Late Flow** phase = **Anabolic** phase [8 days to a few weeks/ months]
        - Gradual restoration of body protein and fat stores and **normalization** of positive nitrogen balance after the metabolic response to trauma is stopped
- ‼️ What is poly trauma?
    - New Berlin Classification (Pape 2014) combines anatomic and physiological parameters.

    - AIS ≥ 3 for **two or more different nine body regions**
    - With additional **one or more variables** from the five physiologic parameters, including
        - SBP ≤ 90 mm Hg,
        - GCS score ≤ 8,
        - base excess ≤ 6.0,
        - INR ≥ 1.4 or partial thromboplastin time ≥ 40 s, and
        - age ≥ 70 years.
    - It can also be definied as an ISS of of > a certain value of which multiple values have been quoted in literature from 15/16/18/25...
- What is injury Severity Score?
    - Score of max 75 points [3 x (5x5)] , **square of AIS of 3 most injured area** (1-6 based on severity). If one site is given as unsurvivable = then automatically 75.

- Evidence for TXA in trauma?
    - Lancet CRASH 2 trial multicenter study of 20,000 patients –
    - Give within 3 hours leads to lower risk of death from bleeding (**1g/10min loading dose, then 1g/8hr).**
    - If After 3 hours, no difference but with paradoxial increased risk of death
- How do you initialially stabilize a poly trauma patient?
    - ATLS

- What are the classes of shock?
    - Shock – 4 classes.
    - 1 = Normal vitals
    - 2 = Tacchycardia,
    - 3 = BP low,
    - 4 = AMS, poor Urine
- What is different with the paediatric polytrauma?
    - Larger **head: body ratio** - head injuries more common
        
        ![Untitled](Polytrauma%20Open%20Fractures%20Mangled%20Limbs%20Skin%20Recon%207941953ae9204e46b5b898b5997e85fb/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - Bones have **higher elasticity** ➔ mainly soft tissue injuries. However, if fractures in pelvis present will denote very high energy trauma
    - Children are usually more **Hemodynamically more stable**
        - Related to ability of children’s vessels to undergo vasoconstriction more readily than atherosclerotic, friable vessels of adults
        - Smaller diameter vessels that can vasoconstrict rapidly
        - Also due to bone elasticity, fractures usally single bone.

### Fracture Blisters

- What do their presence mean?
    - It means significant local tissue trauma
- Clear vs blood filled blisters?
    - Giordano 1994 did skin biopsy, found that both types demonstrate cleavage injury at the dermoepidermal juction
        - Blood filled blisters potentially result in higher rate of complications
    - Strauss et al. found the only predicting factor of infection risk is the placement of skin incision through or near hemorrhagic blisters.
- How should we manage fracture blisters?
    - Sparse orthopaedic literature.
    - Options include - leaving them intact, deroofing or aspiration. Giordano 1995 did not find any difference in outcomes with the 3 strategies
    - Unclear if these are necessary
- Reccomendations?
    - Based on review by Giannoudis in 2021,
    - Early soft tissue edema with immobilization to prevent blister formation
    - Ex fix if required
    - Blisters should be left intact and covered with soft dressings
    - Surgical incisions should be placed away from bllood blister beds due to increased risk of soft tissue complications

### Mangled Limb

- What is the LEAP Study?
    - [2002 NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa012604)
    - It is prospective study of 600 patients, following up for 2 years, mainly looking at the sickness impact profile.
    - Found **no difference in SIP** and functional outcomes, and return to work rates between amputation and reconstruction.
    - **Reconstruction** - more likely to be rehospitalized, additional surgeries and risks of complications
- ‼️ What is the MESS Score? (Exam use MESS)
    - Mangled Extremity Severity Score
    - Score looking at **4 categories** - Skeletal/ soft tissue injury [Energy] , limb ischemia (double if  > 6 hours), Shock, Age (<30/ 30-50/ >50)
        - ASIS
    - Score out of maximum of 14. If < 6 = replantation has 95% success rates
    - > 10 or more = amputation

- What is Ganga Hospital Score?
    - Assess 4 things - skin, bones, muscle units, **comorbids**
    - Score out of 29
    - < 14 = salvage, > 17 amputate
    
    ![Untitled](Polytrauma%20Open%20Fractures%20Mangled%20Limbs%20Skin%20Recon%207941953ae9204e46b5b898b5997e85fb/Untitled%2012.png)
    

- Is the insensate foot an indication for amputation?
    - No
    - [Michael Bose, 2005.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16322607/) Cohort study of 55 patients with insensate foot
    - **More than half regain sensation in 2 years!**
    - Proposed that initial plantar sensation is not prognostic of long term plantar sensory status or functional outcomes and should not be a component of a limb-salvage decision algorithm
- Does the need for free flap help us decide on amputation?
    - [Ellington et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22561743/) JOT, analysis of LEAP study group
    - Found that Mangled foot requiring free flap have significantly worse SIP outcomes compared to primary BKA or salvage with typical skin flap
    

### Skin Reconstruction Ladder

- What is the difference between graft and flaps?
    - Flaps have their own blood supply
    - Flaps are required if bone is exposed
- Difference between split thickness and full thickness skin grafts?
    - **SSG** - better take due to shorter diffusion distance
    - **FTSG** - better reinnervation and sensation, less scar contracture, more durable, more resistant to shear
- What are the variables in split thickness skin graft?
    - **Thickness** - thin, intermedite, thick
    - Meshed vs non meshed
        - Meshed provides greater surface area
        - Lower risk of hematoma and thus less risk of infection and improves uptake
        - Meshed allows better contouring
        - But appearance is less aesthetic
- Technique for graft placement?
    - Key is to maintain good contact for graft uptake
    - Use sutures to hold it down, moist compressive dressing over the graft
    - Post op - avoid excessive motion
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the stages of graft uptake?
    - 1. Fibrin adhesion - graft adhere by fibrin to wound bed.
    - 2. Imbibition - Nutrition via plasma diffusion (days 1-3)
    - 3. **Inosculation** - capillary microanastamosis (day 4)
    - 4. Neovascularization (day 5)
    - 5. Reinnervation (as early as 2-4 weeks)
- Complications to monitor for?
    - Infection, shear stresses (movements), hematoma formation

## FLAPS

- What are the indications for flaps?
    - Soft tissue injury with exposed - bones, tendons, cartilage and orthopaedic implants
- How can you classify flaps?
    - Classification of flaps can be by:
    - **Configuration** - Rotational propellar, Transpositional, advancement
    - **Components** (tissue type) - muscle, fascia + muscle, bone + muscle
    - **Circulation** - Free flap vs Random (aka perforator based flap) vs axial (aka pedicled flap)
        - Axial/ pedicled flap = has its own direct cutaneous artery and vein
        - Random flaps - (+) no need microsurgery
        
        ![Untitled](Polytrauma%20Open%20Fractures%20Mangled%20Limbs%20Skin%20Recon%207941953ae9204e46b5b898b5997e85fb/Untitled%2013.png)

    - Distal Third = Free Flap, reverse sural artery pedicled flap
        - Gracilis – Medial femoral cutaneous A.
        - ALT – Lateral femoral cutaneous A. (-) bulky
        - Lat Dorsi – Thoracodorsal Artery
