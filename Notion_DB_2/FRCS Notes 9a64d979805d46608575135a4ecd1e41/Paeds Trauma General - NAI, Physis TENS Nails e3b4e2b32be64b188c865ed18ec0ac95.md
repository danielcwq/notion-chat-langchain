## Non Accidental Injuries

<aside>
üí° **hx and Pe -** confirm diagnosis of NAI (other injuries) , severity and other injuries (eye, racoon eye, battle‚Äôs sign), need for social services (MSW, Foster care, Poilce)
**invx =** aim to confirm, identify specific fractures
**Mx Goals** = safety, union and functional limb
**Mx principles =**  MDT (social services), specific to injury,

</aside>

- Risk of mortality if you miss a NAI?
    - 10%!
- How will you evaluate this patient? TRIPLE ASSESSMENT
    - **Hx** = risk factors for NAI, injury itself"
        - **Injury =** history discordant with injury, injury discordant with pre-ambulatory status
        - **Parental** - very young, low edu, psychiatric, substance abuse, single
        - **Social factors** - unplanned, job loss, family death, stress
        - **Child Factors** - disabled, premature
    - **PE =**
        - Renital hemorrhages (Fundoscopy)
        - Bruises of different age,
        - Signs of base of skull fracture: battles sign (behind ears), raccoon eyes.

    - Skeletal survey looking for other injuries of different ages
        - Survey consists of = AP/Lateral skull, Lateral of C/T/L spine, AP Pelvis and extremeties, AP chest
        - Corner injuries of the distal femur
        - **Bucket Handle injury** of the Tibia (MOI = whiplash by holding foot and shake) "CML Classic Metaphyseal lesions"
        - Scapular #, Posterior Rib #
        - Upper limb = Distal humerus physeal separation
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What does skeletal survey include?
    - Survey consists of = AP/Lateral **skull**, Lateral of C/T/L spine, AP **Pelvis and extremities**, AP chest
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What are you looking for on skeletal survey?
    - I am looking for 5 fractures that are **highly specific for NAI** = **Corner** fractures, Posterior **Rib** #, **Scapula** #, **spinous process** #, **Sternal** # [CPSSS]
    - Bucket Handle injury of the Tibia (MOI = whiplash by holding foot and shake) aka "CML Classic Metaphyseal lesions" aka corner fractures ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474500/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474500/))
        - CML is a series of planar microfractures across the **metaphysis** (primary spongiosa) of a long bone with the fracture line parallel to, but not involving, the physis.

    - Upper limb = Distal humerus physeal separation
    - **Moderate** specificity = **multiple** fractures, fractures in various stages of healing, physeal separations
- How will you manage (other than the fracture)?
    - Activate multidisciplinary team, POLICE, Social worker, Foster care

## Paeds Trauma General

- Why does paeds bone heal faster?
    - 1. Periosteum **more vascular** than adults
    - 2. **Thick inner cambium** layer that has high osteogenic potential ‚ûî faster healing
    - 3. **Periosteal hinge** helps in reduction
- Which direction does remodelling occur?
    - Remodels well "in the plane of motion"
    - E.g. in supracondylar, it remodells well in Flexion/ extension but not in Varus/ Valgus
- Types of incomplete fractures due to plasticity?
    - Compression = Buckle/ Torus fracture
    - Tension = Green stick facture
- Difference from adults (5S)?
    - **Size** - small
    - **Soft** tissue buffer less
    - **Skeleton** less calcified, more flexible
        - May have internal injuries without external signs (due to elasticity w/o fractures)
    - **Surface area to body volume ratio increased** = greater heat and moisture loss. (Risk of hypothermia)
    - Spine
        - Large head ‚Äî> requires spinal board with cut out
- Which elbow fat pad can be normal and which is always abnormal?
    - An **anterior** fat pad is often normal
    - However a posterior fat pad seen on a lateral x-ray of the elbow is always abnormal.
    - It is due to effusion pushing the elbow fat pad more posteriorly, such that it is now visible. It is not fluid we are seeing, But fat‚Ä¶

## Paeds Physeal Injuries

- Which layer does Physeal injuries occur in? Why?
    - Occurs through **Provisional Calcification** of Hypertrophic zone
    - Due to decreased ECM to cellular ratio
- Classification of physeal injuries?
    - Salter Harris
    - Type 1 = Slide
    - 2 ‚ÄúAbove‚Äù = metaphyseal fragment
        - ‚ÄúThurston Holland Fragment‚Äù
    - 3 ‚ÄúbeLow‚Äù = epiphysis split
    - 4 = ‚ÄúThrough‚Äù = Meta and Epi split
    - 5 = Crush
    - **+ Rang and Ogden Modification**
        - 6 = Trauma to perichondrium with tethering of growth plate
        - 7 = Osteochondral fracture
        - 8 = Metaphysis fracture
        - 9 = Avulsion injury to periosteum
- What other classification for physeal injuries?
    - Rang and Ogden additions to the salter harris
    - 6 = trauma to perichondrium
    - 7 = **osteochondral** fracture
    - 8 = fracture of **metaphysis**
    - 9 = **Avulsion** to periosteum
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Most Salter Harris common examples?
    - Type 1 = Fibula
    - 2 = Distal radius!
    - 3 = TIllaux
    - 4 = Lateral condyle fracture! - particularly Milch type 1 through capitellum ossification center
        
        ![Untitled](Paeds%20Trauma%20General%20-%20NAI,%20Physis%20TENS%20Nails%20e3b4e2b32be64b188c865ed18ec0ac95/Untitled%203.png)
        
- Why is the SH 4 worse than SH 1?
    - Articular joint surface is disrupted
    - **Resting zone** is affected in SH 4
    - This is why Milch 1 lateral condyle fracture which is SH4 ‚ûî cubitus valgus
- **CRITOE sequence at 1/3/5/7/9/11?**
    - Capitellum, Radial head, Internal (medial) epicondlyle, trochlea, olecranon, External (lateral) epicondyle
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Elbow Physis Closure sequence?
    - 12 yo, E, C, T start to fuse together
    - 15 yo ECT fuse to humerus, O and R fuses
    - 17 yo medial condyle fuses

- Causes of Physeal Bars?
    - Causes = **TIT**
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Classifx of Physeal bars?
    - **Ogden** - depending on extent of involvement
    - Type 1 = Peripheral
    - 2 = Central
    - 3 = Complete
- What happens when you get a physeal bar?
    - It depends on the extent of the bar
    - If central/ complete ‚ûî LLD
    - if peripheral ‚ûî angular deformity
- Management of **LLD Physeal bar with no angulation** (This means complete or central)?
    - CT scan to evaluate size
    - < 40% central Bar ‚ûî Consider resection
    - > 40% ‚ûî No point resecting. Manage as per LLD
    - [Approach to LLD](https://www.notion.so/Approach-to-LLD-d4a5e308066e4a88b6dc04d0c3c4e806)
- Management of **Angular Physeal Bar?**
    - Need to address both **angulation** and **LLD**
    - Dependant on skeletal age and size of bar
    - CT scan to evaluate extent of bar
        - If **mature, regardless of size of bar**
            - no more opportunity for remodelling ‚ûî Plan for definitive osteotomy to correct angulation
        - If **immature**, we look at size of bar:
            - **If < 40% and immature** = consider **resection** with interposition with concomittant hemiepiphsiodesis
                - Langenskoild technique with metaphyseal cortical window with interpositional graft (fat/ bone wax/ PMMA)
            - **If > 40% =** Hemiepiphysiodesis; no need to excise the bar
        - May need subsequent lengthening.
- Epiphysis vs Apophysis?
    - **Epiphysis** contributes to longitudinal growth
    - **Apophysis** are growth plates that does not contribute to longitudinal growth. Stes of tendon or ligament attachments e.g. tibial tubercle, medial epicondyle

## TENS Nails Principles

- How does the TENS nail confer stability?
    - Confers stability in **4 planes** (bending, axial, translational, rotational) via **3 point fixation** and engagement into metaphyseal bone
    - Translational stability - "symmetrically and identically pre-bent nails"
    - Avoid in long oblique and spiral fractures
- How do you choose the size of nail?
    - Size = **0.4** of medullary canal; so that if 2 nails, at least 80% fill
    - If forearm - can attempt to fill up entire bone
- Technique of insertion?
    - Small incision under II guidance ‚ûî entry point made with **awl**
    - Insert with **oscillating** manoeuvre while avoiding mallet
    - Insertion of end cap
- General **contraindications** for TENS nails?
    - "Length unstable" fractures - comminution/ long spiral fractures
    - Specific CI for femur - > 50kg, > 11 years old (Moroz et al.)
- How do you prevent nail migration?
    - Insertion of end caps which are placed over nail ends and screwed into cortical bone at the entry point with self cutting threads (Windolf et al. 2015)

- INSERTION POINTS for forearm?
    - **Radius** - retrograde via **radial styloid** (more common), lister‚Äôs tubercle (SRN); proximal to physis
    - **Ulnar** - antegrade via olecranon; distal to physis
- Insertion points for Humeral Shaft?
    - Retrograde via posterolateral off the lateral supracondylar ridge
        
        ![Untitled](Paeds%20Trauma%20General%20-%20NAI,%20Physis%20TENS%20Nails%20e3b4e2b32be64b188c865ed18ec0ac95/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - Antegrade via level of attachment of deltoid (both same side)
- Insertion points for **femur**?
    - **Ascending technique** - Medial and lateral condyles, proximal to physis [KKH - more commonly done]
    
    ![Untitled](Paeds%20Trauma%20General%20-%20NAI,%20Physis%20TENS%20Nails%20e3b4e2b32be64b188c865ed18ec0ac95/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - **Descending technique** Sub trochanteric area separated by 1-2cm

- Insertion points for **Tibia**?
    - inferior to proximal tibia physis; medial + lateral
