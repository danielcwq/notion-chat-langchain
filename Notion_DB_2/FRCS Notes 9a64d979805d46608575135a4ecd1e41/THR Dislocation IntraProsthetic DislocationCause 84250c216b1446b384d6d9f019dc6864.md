Topic: Hip

- What is the ideal THR implant positioning?
    - Ideal is to place the implant **primary arc range within patient's functional range**
    - Lewinnek proposed Safe zones in 1978
        - Cup inclincation 40 +/- 10; anteversion 15 +/- 10
        - Stem anteversion ~ 15 deg
    - However aware that studies show that even when placed in this position, dislocations still occur
    - Recent publications suggest other methods of determining positioning such as the concept of Combined anteversion proposed by Dorr et al. in 2009. **Target is 35 +/10**
    - Without navigation, this can be assessed with the Ranawat Sign intraoperatively but less accurately. Patient must be in lateral position and hip stabilized
    - This is done by placing operated leg in extension, internally rotate from neutral foot position until base of femoral head is parallel to the acetabulum component
    - This angle will be the **combined anteversion angle. Target is 35 +/-10**

- What are the **risk factors** for dislocated THR?
    - **Patient** – NOF#, spine fusion first, neuromuscular conditions, alcoholic, spinopelvic, **High ASA** (more comorbids)
    - **Implant** – small head, use of skirt, lipped liner
    - **Surgeon** – approach (NJR no differences. But posterior must repair soft tissue), malposition, osteophyte impingement, failure to restore offset, non union of GT fracture causing poor soft tissue tension
    - **Pathology for THR -** Femoral neck # higher risk of dislocation
    
    [Factors predisposing to dislocation after primary total hip arthroplasty: a multivariate analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11938502/)
    
    High ASA score - risk factor for THR dislocation
    

- Controversy - is Hip THR or spine fusion first?
    - Malkani 2019 in Arthroplasty –
        - **Spine Fusion then THR - even up to 5 years) higher risk of dislocation** (50% more)
    - Buckland et al. JBJS 2017
        - THA after spinal fusion. Risks increases with each level of fusion
        - Control group 1.55%
        - 1-2 levels  2.96%
        - 3-7 levels 4.12%
        
        [Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28455466/)
        
    - THR then fusion - lower risk
        - Reasons may include **decreasing pelvic mobility in a stable, well-healed THA** or early postoperative spine precautions after LSF restricting positions of dislocation.

    - Consider **Dual mobility cups** in THR with prior fusion.

- How does a stiff spine increase risk of Hip dislocation?
    - As one goes from standing to sitting, lumbar lordosis decreases and pelvis should tilt posterior (reduced sacral slope and increased pelvic tilt) to accomodate femoral flexion
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled.png)
        
    - If the spino pelvic junction is fused surgically or biologically, the pelvis moves very little and the acetabular cup is **"fixed in space"**
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%201.png)
        
    - Thus the femur may impinge anteriorly and subsequently, dislocate posteriorly.

- What implant factors increases hip stability?
    - Head diameter corresponds to:
    - **Primary arc range** that is determined by the head-neck ratio
        - Def: Range between impingement
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%202.png)

    - **Lever range = jump distance** = distance allowed before hip dislocates
        - It is proportionate to the radius of the head (but not the radius)
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%205.png)
            
    - **Excursion distance** = distance head must travel to dislocate = radius of the femoral head
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Offset
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%207.png)
        
- What affects the head-neck-ratio/ Primary arc range?
    - The head–neck ratio is affected by femoral **head size**, femoral **neck geometry**, and the use of a **skirt** on the femoral head.
    - Skirt is used to extend the neck length when the plus head is still insufficient
    - Trapezoidal shaped neck gives a better head-neck ratio

- What features increase acetabular impingement?
    - Chamfer geometry of the PE cup rim
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - Presence of extended-rim hooded liner (if placed incorrectly)
    - Too horizontal/ closed/ too low anteversion
    - Failing to remove acetabular osteophytes that impinge against the neck
- What is the **acute management** of the THR dislocation?
    - ATLS, ensure isolated, reduce with Allis maneuver under sedation
    - If unable to, can consider bring to OT do under GA and paralysis
    - Temporary immobilization with abduction pillow/ knee immoblizer
    - Assess risk factors **TRO infection**
        - Need TRO infection in history, bloods (FBC, CRP, ESR)
        - Assess surgical notes – approach and repair of capsule, elevated rim liner?
        - Interval XR to assess for osteolysis, PE wear (superior migration of head)
        - First time or recurrent? Interval symptom free period?
        - MOI – significant trauma?
- What if you cannot reduce the dislocation closed?
    - Do not rush into open reduction
    - Investigate with advanced imaging, TRO infection
- What is the management for FIRST TIME THR dislocation?
    - Conservative management
    - Can consider bracing (abduction)
    - Need to address if there is definite obvious, treatable cause - e.g. GT non union
- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the success rate of non operative treatment of THR dislocation?
    - Up to **2/3 of patients do not need surgical revision**
    - In this paper, 0.63 incidence with 92 patients out of 14000 THR done. Only 16 dislocated more than once and required revision

- What is the investigation for recurrent THR dislocation?
    - CT scan to measure implant positioning - instruction to take a few cuts at distal femur to reference from the **distal femoral intercondylar axis**
    - Acetabuluar - inclination, anteversion
    - Femoral - anteversion, offset
- What surgical **principles and options** for recurrent THR dislocation?
    - Principles are to Address biomechanical deficiencies
        - Correct alignment of femur and acetabulum
        - Correct soft tissue tension
            - GT fracture ➔ fix
            - GT advancement
        - Remove impinging osteophytes
        - Correct the offset
        - Change implants as required:
    - **Hemispherical** cup with larger head size to increase head-neck ratio and corresponding primary arc range, lever range and jump distance
        
        
    - **Dual Mobility** Cups aka Tripolar aka (Modular Dual Mobility MDM by stryker)
        - Femoral head that moves within a PE component, which also moves within a shell
            
            ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%2010.png)
            
        - Consider in patients with prior spine fusion/ dislocating THR
        - Greater ROM and stability, smaller head less wear
        - ➖ Higher constraint = increased wear
    - **Constrained** Cup [for neuromuscular conditions]
        - = Head locked in cup
        - Higher constraint = increased wear
    - ***Miller’s Course options:***
        - 1. **Most** address with **36mm head**
        - 2. Dual mobility
            - 2017 Hip Society Otto Aufranc Award – Compared to 40mm head, Dual mobility cup lower risk of dislocation, revision, reoperation
        - 3. Rarely use constrained head
- Pang Hee Nee: When do you use a constrained cup? What are the limits of dual mobility?
    - **Irradiated** cancer cases ➔ hip abductors do not work
    - Previous hip fusion take down ➔ Hip abductors often do not function well
- ‼️ How do you revise this hip with recurrent dislocation?
    - Complex revision
    - Pre op
        - Templating
        - Stand by equipment
    - Intraop
        - Extensile posterior approach
        - Correct the alignment
        - Change implants
    - Post op - standard post THR
- What are the salvage options?
    - **Bipolar** conversion - maximises head/neck ratio
        - (-) groin pain, medial migration
    - Excision girdlestone
- Is Dislocated bipolar hemiarthroplasty worse or THR?
    - Success non operative treatment of dislocated Bipolar is much lower than THR
    - In paper by Gill et al., Single closed reduction of a dislocated hemiarthroplasty was only successful in 16% of the patients
    - 70% occur in first month, 98% within first 3 months
        - Only 16% successfully treated with first closed reduction
        - 10% required open reduction and successful after

- What are the risk factors of Bipolar dislocation?
    - Smaller center edge angle with CEA < 45.4 ° or acetabular depth of 19.12mm more likely to suffer dislocation

- PJI in the setting of a unstable hip? [SOA]
    - Treat as PJI ➔ depends on patient co-morbids
        - Single Stage stage - conversion to THR KIV dual mobility (SOA Pang Hee Nee)
            - First remove and debride
            - Second, change equipment and insert
        - 2 Stage
    - Go for salvage with Girdlestone excision arthroplasty
    - Salvage with reaming of acetabulum and re-insert bipolar
    - Salvage with conversion THR
- Instability due to eccentric wear, stable implants. What can you do?

    - Liner wear If positioning is reasonable)
    - revIsion THR (if alignment is poor)
    

## Dual Mobility Cups

- How does dual mobility hips work?
    - 2 articulations - one between head the liner, and another between liner and metal cup
    - It is an **“impingement device”** - whereby it requires the implant to impinge on the inner PE-head articulation before it starts to articulate in the outer PE-cup articulation
        
        ![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%2013.png)
        
    - They work by increasing the primary arc range, jump distance, head neck ratio
    - THA movement initiates in the smaller articulation to the point when prosthetic neck start to impinge on the PE liner rim ➔ second articulation

![Untitled](THR%20Dislocation%20IntraProsthetic%20DislocationCause%2084250c216b1446b384d6d9f019dc6864/Untitled%2014.png)

- What is this?
    - Intra-prosthetic dislocation, a unique complication of a dual mobility hip
    - 2 signs
        - Eccentric position of the prosthetic head within the cup due to direct contact of head with cup
        - Bubble sign. Even when the implant is reduced, can see the bubble sign to diagnose the dual mobility liner is out
- What is the significance of missing this?
    - Failure to diagnose this may result in acetabular cup wear due to articulation directly between femoral head and highly polished interior cup surface
- ⚠️ What are the causes of IPD?
    - Type 1 = **wear** of the retention rim of the PE liner; normal functioning
    - Type 2 = Due to blocking of the larger articulation e.g. by **heterotopic ossification**
    - Type 3 = due to **loosening**
- What imaging?
    - CT scan - evaluate for any potential blocks to mobility - heterotopic ossification
    - Evaluate implant placement for revision
- Management of IPD?
    - Cannot be managed by close reduction and necessitates a revision of the PE component
    - Ensure proper positioning of implants
