Topic: Hand

- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the spaces and boundaries of the hand?
    - **Thenar** - floor is Adductor pollicis, medial is **midpalmar** septum, lateral is 1MC bone; roof is the pollicis tendons and muscles
    - **Hypothenar** -  lateral wall is **hypothenar** septum and 5th MC. Contains 3 muscles - FDM, ADM, ODM.
    - **Mid palmar** bounded by mid palmar septum [spans from 3rd MC to palmar aponeurosis] and hypothenar septum, Ceiling is the flexor tendons, Floor is 3-5MC and Interosseous muscles
    - **Dorsal subaponeurotic space** Potential space **deep to extensor tendons** and dorsal to Metacarpals

- What bounds the space of Parona?
    - Floor = Pronator quadratus
    - Roof = flexor tendons, FPL, FCU (Subtendinous space as it is below all the tendons)
    
    ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%201.png)
    
- What are the bursas and sheaths?
    - Flexor tendon sheaths stop at the distal flexor crease in the palm
    - Flexor tendon sheaths of little finger and thumb continues to form the ulnar and radial bursa respectively
    - Ulnar and radial bursa communicates at the distal forearm in the **parona space**
- Most common bacteria?
    - Staph aureus

### PYOGENIC FLEXOR TENOSYNOVITIS

- What is horseshoe abscess?
    - Pus tracking through the flexor sheaths of thumb and little fingers ➔ radial and ulnar bursa respectively ➔ into the Parona's space
- What are the **Kanavel's signs**?
    - Flexed, Fusiform swelling, Pain on Passive extension, Tender sheath
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%202.png)
        
- What classification for Flexor tenosynovitis?
    - **Michon’s (intraoperative)**
    - 1 = **serous** fluid
    - 2 = **Pus**
    - 3 = **necrosis** of tendon/ pulley

- Pyogenic Flexor Tenosynovitis - What are poor prognostic factors? What is the risk of amputation? What are the expected outcomes?
    - Pang Hee Nee et al. JBJS 2007. 75 patients over 6 years. Identified 5 risk factors with poor outcomes
        - 1. Age > **43**,
        - 2. Comorbids - DM PVD CKD
        - 3. Pus (michon 2)
        - 4. Digital **Ischemia**
        - 5. Polymicrobial
    - [Outcomes] **He further divided patients into 3 groups**
        - **Group 1** = no pus (michon 1), no ischemia ➔ 0% amputation; 80% ROM
        - **2** = Pus (michon 2) but no ischemia ➔ 8% amputation, **72%** ROM
        - **3** = Pus (michon 2) and **ischemia**   ➔ **60%** amputation, **50%** ROM

- Management?
    - Mx = Open surgical drainage, relook and secondary closure
    - Brunner incision OR midlateral incision is also done
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%203.png)
        
- Open irrigation vs Closed catheter irrigation?
    - Described by Neviaser in 1978 - use of indwelling catheter inserted under the A1 pulley and irrigated from proximal to distal. [no specific selection criteria]
    - Sheath is then flushed manually with 50mls every 2 hours
        
        [neviaser1978.pdf](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/neviaser1978.pdf)
        
    - Recent studies show potentially no difference between open or closed irrigation (with or without continuous irrigation) however, patient selection is key. Can consider in early stage with no poor prognostic factors

- How to do closed catheter irrigation?
    - 2 small incisions placed distally at A5 and A1 pulley using a angiocatheter
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Continued irrigation may or may not be done after closed cathetier irrigation - some studies show it is not necessary

### DEEP SPACE/ COLLAR BUTTON INFECTION

- What are deep space infections?
    - It is infection of the one of 3 spaces - thenar, midpalmar and hypothenar spaces
    - They can spread via lumbrical canals/ webspaces or infected tendon sheaths
- How will you drain each of the 3 types of deep infection?
    - **Thenar** - volar incision along thenar muscle bulk
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - **Midpalmar** - Curvilinear approach, transverse incision through distal palmar crease
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - **Hypothenar** - volar longitudinal incision along medial aspect of hypothenar eminence
        
        ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%207.png)
        
- What are collar button infection?
    - It is the infection of subfascial web space
- How will you drain collar button aka Hourglass abscess?
    - Incision over centred at epicenter of infection, extensile towards carpal tunnel
    - Volar/ Dorsal or combined incision but Web should not be incised
    
    ![Untitled](Hand%20Infections%2090b491140e064773a1a0463d30669e04/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - Leave wound open for 48h ➔ relook with secondary closure
- How do you drain dorsal subaponeurotic space?
    - 2 longitudinal incisions
    - one over 2nd MC
    - second one between 4/5 MC

### FELON

- Pathoanatomy?
    - Pad is a closed compartment with fibrous septa
    - Swelling and pressure within micro-compartments, leading to ‘compartment syndrome'
- What incision?
    - mid lateral over ulnar side of 2/3/4 and radial side for thumb/ 5
    - Avoid fishmouth/ parallel incisions!

### FIGHT BITES

- What bug for fight bites?
    - Staph aureus, but also Eikenella Corrodens
- Clinical assessment
    - Vague history
    - Wound over MCPJ; need to assess tendons
- Management?
    - Acute = IM ATT, IV ABx
    - **1st stage** = debride, assess, wash, tag tendons if cut (not primary repair)
    - **2nd stage** = relook and repair and secondary closure

### ANIMAL BITES

- Most common animal?
    - Dog bites (90%), Cat (10%)
- What bug?
    - Most are polymicrobial
    - Pasteurella Multicida
        - 25-50% of dog bites
        - 80% of cat bites
