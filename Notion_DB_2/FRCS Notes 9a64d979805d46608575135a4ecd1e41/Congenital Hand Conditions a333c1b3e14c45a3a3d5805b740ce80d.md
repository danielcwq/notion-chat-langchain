### ****Thumb Duplication (polydactyly) [1/10] (‼️)****

![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%201.png)

- What is this? [Approach]
    - This is a clinical photo of thumb duplication aka Preaxial polydactyly
        - 1. Level of Duplication - hazard a guess
        - 2. Which duplicate dominate - radio/ ulnar
        - 3. Assess **web space**
        - 4. Rotation/ angular deformity of thumb
        - 5. Stability of MCPJ/ IPJ
    - Hx and PE -
    - Offer to look at XR
- Inheritance/ Genes of polydactyly?
    - It is a swanson type 3 deformity - [‼️ Classification of hand deformities?](3%20Embryology%20and%20Physis%206497cfd095414b1a92a97feac3a362ae.md)
    - G - **Sonic hedgehog gene** mutation
    - E - Affecting **zone of Polarizing activity (ZPA)** in limb growth; affecting radial-ulna growth
- What will you ask parents?
    - Family history - can be AD inheritance
    - Other medical conditions - triphalangism associations systemic medical issues
- How will you assess clinically?

    - 1. Assess Duplicate
        - Decide - which is the duplicate, cosmesis by cover test, look at finger bulk
        - Compared with contralateral side
        - Compared with index finger
        - Aim to be bigger than index finger and at least 70% of contralateral side
        - Nail folds - integrity
    - 2. Evaluate Joint stability, contractures
        - Skin creases over joints - suggests good mobility
        - 1st web contracture - may be contracted and need to be lengthened (if tight unable to grip things
        - Stability - ulnar, radial deviation, hyperextension at MCPJ, IPJ
    - 3. Tendons - check EPL, FPL if cooperative
    - 4. Neurovascular of each digit - digital allens test, 2PD
    - 5. Function - key, pen.
- What is the classification? Which most common?
    - **Wassel** Classification
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - 1/2 bifid and duplicate DP
    - 3/4 bifid and duplicate PP
    - 5/6 Bifid and Duplicate MC
    - 7 = traiphalangia = type 4 with one of them extra phalanx (3 phalanges)
    - MOST COMMON IS TYPE 4  - 43%
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%204.png)
        
- What is the issue with Wassel 4?
    - Wassel 4 involves the **MCPJ**, have to be mindful when reconstructing to also repair or reattach the collateral ligaments to prevent ulnar and radial deviation and instablity (actually this principle is also for the IPJ)
- Which type is associated with syndromes? What syndromes?
    - Type 7 - Triphalangia
    
    - Associated Syndromes Set for various conditions
        - **Blood dyscrasias** -
            - **Fanconi** Anemia - AR condition, mean survival 16 yo
            - **TAR** (thrombocytopenia with absent Radius) - AR condition. Rare. A/w cardiac abnormalities - Atrial Septal Defect, Tetralogy of Fallot
        - **Congenital heart abnormalities** - **Holt-Oram** [heart + radius problem only]
        - **VACTERL syndrome** -
            - **V**ertebral defects, **A**nal atresia, **C**ardiac defects, **T**racheo-esophageal fistula, **E**sophageal Atresia, **R**enal anomalies, Limb abnormalities
- What are the **goals of treatment**?
    - To achieve adequate **size**, **webspace**, **stable** joint, good **power**, **cosmesis, neurovascular**
- What surgical options?
    - Most difficult scenario is if both thumbs are hypoplastic and CMCJ is not satisfactory. In this case, no reconstruction is ideal.
    - Options are
        1. Simple excision of floating thumb (Ablation)
        - **Types 1 and 2** = Combination Bilhaut Cloquet procedure
            
            ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%205.png)
            
            - Bilhault Cloquet procedure (this procedure is only for type 1/2)
            - This is done if both duplicates are smaller than necessary and need to combine
        - **Types 3 and 4 =** Removal and reconstruction
            - Need to reconstruct collateral ligaments
            - Reinsertion of APB
            - May need to centralize the EPL/ FPL
            - Wedge osteotomy to correct alignment (e.g. in divergent convergent type 4)
            - Widening of 1st web space if type
            
            ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%206.png)
            
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%207.png)
    
- When we do surgery?
    - Early but not premature
    - After 1 year of age
    - Do surgery
- Post op management?
    - bulky dressing - in a boxing glove method to prevent dressing getting loose
    - Use absorbable sutures for closure (no need STO)
    - If osteotomy - can remove wires 4-6 weeks

### OTHER TYPES OF POLYDACTYLY

- Postaxial Polydactyly

### Trigger Thumb [2/10] (‼️)/ Congenital Clasped Thumb (❌)

![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%209.png)

![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2010.png)

- What is the pathoanatomy?
    - Notta's node on FPL
- What is the natural history?
    - **30%** resolve spontaneously < 1 year
    - After 1 year, < 10% resolve
- What classification?
    - Swanson group 2, differentiation issue
- What other condition must you differentiate this from?
    - Congenital Clasped Thumb
- How do differentiate congenital clasped thumb with trigger thumb?
    - **Bilaterality** - Trigger thumb commonly unilateral, clapsed thumb commonly bilateral
    - Trigger thumb has flexion of **IPJ** that cannot be passively extended
    - Clasped thumb flexion deformity is at the **MPJ** and is passively correctible
    - Trigger thumb has **notta's node**
- How do you clinically asses?
    - hx + PE
        - usually FFD rather than triggering at the IPJ
        - Flexor tendon nodule
        - Differentiate from congenital clasped thumb
        - Need TRO other contractures - arthrogryposis/ spasticity (Cerebral palsy)
- Management of trigger thumb?
    - Non op - 30% resolve in < 1 year
    - Surgery
        - Surgical release before 3 years old to prevent permanent structural changes
        - Open release of A1 pulley

- How do you perform open release of trigger thumb?
    - Small transverse incision in the thumb MCP flexion crease.
    - Keep thumb in **flexion**, protect the radial digital nerve, sharp dissection of the A1 pulley (usually normal looking) distal to tendon nodule
    - Identify Notta nodule in FPL tendon, watch nodule under direct vision during passive IP ext of thumb to ensure smooth FPL tendon gliding

## Congenital Clasped Thumb

- What is the deficiency in congenital clasped thumb?
    - Congenital deficiency of extensor mechanism, primarily the **EPB** muscle (attaches to base of Proximal Phalanx) ➔ inability to extend MPJ
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2012.png)
        
    - If EPL also deficient, then patient will be unable to extend the IPJ
- ‼️ Classification of clasped thumb?
    - **Tsuyuguchi** classification
    - Type 1 = supple
    - Type 2 = Contracture - cannot be passively extended
    - Type 3 = a/w arthrogryposis
- Management of clasped thumb?
    - Splinting has high rates of success
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2013.png)
        
    - If severe ➔ soft tissue release and tendon transfer

### ****Radial Club Hand [6/10 - 2%] (‼️) +**** Hypoplastic Thumb [5/10 - 3%] (#‼️)

![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2014.png)

- What is this?
    - Radius completely absent
    - Ulnar thick and curved
    - Wrist is radially deviated (no radius) and radial carpal bones absent/ hypoplastic
    - 5 finger rays present but thumb is hypoplastic
- I will want to go on to assess the patient clinically with Hx, PE, Invx?
    - Determine if this is "Isolated sporadic vs Syndromic"
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2016.png)
    
    - **UNILATERAL vs BILATERAL**
    - Hx from parents - history of syndromes, heart issues, surgeries of anus, trachea, esophagus
    - PE
        - Unilateral vs Bilateral
        - Observe function and movements
        - Assess thumb function and deformity
        - Assess elbow movement and contractures (or loss of skin creases)
        - Heart exam - for murmurs
    - Other associated deformities
- Why is it important to check elbow function?
    - If it is fixed, then this radial deviation deformity is a compensation.
    - Correcting it can “**Defunction the arm”**
- How will you examine the patient with hypoplastic thumb?
    - **Pollex** abductus - FPL attaches to EPL also. So when FPL flexes, thumb abducts at same time
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2017.png)

    - Ulnar collateral ligament laxity
    - Web space contractures
- What investigations for radial club hand/ Thumb hypoplasia?
    - **FBC** - anemias, low platelet
    - Peripheral Blood film - Fanconi
    - Renal US - VACTERL
    - Echo - Holt Oram, VACTERL
- What is radial club hand? What gene? [same for hypoplastic thumb]
    - G - sonic hedgehog gene mutation
    - E - Affecting **zone of Polarizing activity (ZPA)** in limb growth; affecting radial-ulna growth
    - I - Non genetic (unless syndromic)
- ‼️ How do you classify the Radial Club Hand?
    - Bayne and Klug
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2018.png)
    
    - Type 1 = Deficient distal **epiphysis**
    - Type 2 = Deficient prox and distal epiphysis
    - Type 3 = Partial aplasia (distal part not present)
    - **Type 4 = total absence (most common!)**
- ‼️ How do you classify the **thumb hypoplasia** deformity?
    - Blauth
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2019.png)
    
    - Type 1 = **minor** hypoplasia; normal function
    - 2 = **Moderate** hypoplasia, **MCPJ** instability
    - 3 = **severe hypoplasia**
        - 3A stable CMCJ. Flexor, extensor tendon tethering. Need to release
        - 3B unstable CMCJ
    - 4 = **floating** thumb (no 1st MC)
    - 5 = total **absence** of thumb - MOST COMMON (same as total absent radius is most common)
- How will you manage this child with Radial Club hand?
    - I will start non-operative treatment immediate after birth which includes **passive stretching ex and early splinting**
    - Surgery is **mainly cosmesis rather than restore function** as they are normally quite functional; able to bring fingers into favourable position
    - Then, I will offer operative correction at the age of around **6-12 months**( timing controversial; children have meaningful hand manipulation at the age of 10 months)
- When will you NOT operate [CONTRAINDICATIONS]?
    - Mild deformity with adequate radial support - types 1, 2
    - Severe soft tissue contractures - risk of NV injury
    - Severe elbow **extension** contracture [No elbow crease] - hand already compensated!
    - Older patients who have accepted deformity and adjusted accordingly
- When will you operate?
    - 6-12 months of age
- What are the surgical principles?
    - 1. Address **club hand** with centralization
    - 2. Address **thumb hypoplasia** based on Blauth classification
    - 3. Restoration of **elbow flexion** by triceps transfer
- What are the principles of **Centralization**?
    - "Combination of Bony and soft tissue procedures"
    - 1. **Bony** - Resection varying amounts of carpus, Angular osteotomy of ulna
    - 2. **Soft tissue** - release of radial structures - brachioradialis, ECRL, ECRB, APL KIV transfer e.g. **ECRL from 2MT to 5MT base**
    - 3. **Re-align** 3rd MT at right angles to the plane of distal ulnar epiphyseal platE
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2020.png)
    
- What are the principles of treating thumb hypoplasia?
    - Blauth 2 and 3A **[Stable CMCJ]** Surgery = ****
        - **1. Huber** transfer [opponensplasty] – abductor digiti minimi to Abductor Pollicis transfer,
        - 2. **UCL** reconstruction [MCPJ instability]
        - 3. 1st web space release
        - 4. **Release** flexor and extensor tendons if tethered
    - Blauth 3B - 5 **[Unstable CMCJ or absent thumb]** = **Pollicization vs 2nd toe Transfer** (no consensus)
        - **Pollicization** = Buck Gramcko technique; converting Index finger to thumb
            
            ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2021.png)
            
            - Remove index finger Metacarpal, leaving head of MC to act as trapazium
            - P1 becomes the "metacarpal"
        - **2nd toe transfer**
            
            ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2022.png)
            
- Complications of Centralization?
    - Growth arrest of distal ulna, wrist ankylosis, recurrent instability, neurovascular injury, infection, fracture of ulna
- What if recurrent? Salvage?
    - Ulnocarpal Arthrodesis

![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2023.png)

- Do not miss the scars. THis means it is a RECURRENT radial club hand. May need salvage procedures

### Syndactyly [3/10] (#❌ )

- Inheritance pattern?
    - **AD**, 50% bilateral
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2024.png)
    
- What are the associated conditions?
    - **Apert’s** – premature closure of physes of skull - carniosynostosis
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2025.png)
        
    - **Poland** Syndrome – Sprengel’s deformity, unilateral chest wall hypoplasia
    - **Carpenter** – craniofascial malfunction, obesity
    - **Arthrogryposis**
    - Constriction band syndrome
- Classification of syndactyly?
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2026.png)
    
    - **Complete or Incomplete?**
        - Complete if it involves nail folds
    - **Simple or Complex or Complicated?**
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2027.png)
        
        - Simple = skin only
        - Complex = involves bones
        - Complicated = involves bones, ligaments,tendons
- Surgical principles?
    - 1. **Timing** – 1-2yo
        - Balance between GA and size of structures
        - Do earlier if border/ peripheral digit as they are different lengths and will result in more deformity)
    - 2. **Commisure** reconstruction - with **zig zag** incision
    - 3. Skin **grafting** - needed in complete syndactyly
    - 4. **Single vs multiple stage**
        - **Multiple fingers** ➔ staged due to risk of ischemia
        - Do **border digits first** due to marked difference in lengths to prevent tethering of longer digits ➔ flexion contractures and rotational deformity.
    - Border digits
- Surgical technique?
    - Create **web commissure** with Volar and dorsal zig zag incision
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2028.png)
    
    - Preserve and protect digital NVB
    - Local flap to reconstruct web space; may need graft from groin
- Complications?
    - **Web creep,** contractures, instability
    - Nail abnormalities
    
    ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2029.png)
    

### ****Symbrachydactyly [4/10] (❌)****

- What is symbrachydactyly?
    - Syndactyly + Short fingers
    - Can be distinguished from constriction band syndrome
- What is the classification of symbrachydactyly?
    - Blauth and Gekeler 4 types
        - Type 1 = Short fingers
        - 2 = Oligodactylic = atypical cleft hand. Central portion aplastic, border digits less affected
        - 3 = Monodactylic = all fingers gone except thumb aplasia
        - 4 = Peromelic = resembles a trasverse amputation at the MCPJ level.
    - Can also describe by number of fingers present
        - Adactylous = no fingers (type 3)
        - Monodactylous = only thumb (type 3)
        - Bidactylous = thumb + little finger (type 2)
        - Multidigits (Type 1)
            
            ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2030.png)
            
- Management?
    - Ranges from removal of nubbins, to toe transfers
    - If do op, do before 15 months to allow child to adapt

### Radioulnar Synostosis (#❗️ )

- Pathophysiology
    - Failure of differentiation (Swanson type 2) in the proximal aspect of the forearm
- Inheritance of radioulnar synostoses?
    - Usually sporadic but Familial cases with Autosomal dominance
    - RARE, bilateral in 60%
    - **Associated with syndromes** - apert, arthrogryposis, klinefelter's syndrome
- Clinical features of radioulnar synostosis?
    - Spectrum of fixed and limited pronation/ supination
    - Look at other associated syndromes
        - Other joints for arthrogryposis,
        - Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) - male with extra X chromosome.
            - Features of female - large breasts, small penis, less hair
        - Apert syndrome - microcephaly
- Why is the arm commonly fixed in pronation?
    - Limb bud in UL starts in pronation and progress to supination
    - This is opposite from the LL which stays in pronation
- ‼️ ⚠️ Classification of radioulnar synostosis?
    - **Cleary and Omar** - Based on fibrous vs bony, location
    - Type 1 = Fibrous
    - 2 = Bony
    - 3 = Bony + **posterior dislocation** of radius
    - 4 = Bony + **anterior dislocation** of radius
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2031.png)
        
        ![Untitled](Congenital%20Hand%20Conditions%20a333c1b3e14c45a3a3d5805b740ce80d/Untitled%2032.png)
        
- Management of radioulnar synostosis?
    - Usually conservative management as the shoulder is able to compensate sufficiently
- What are the 2 broad options of management?
    - **1. Mobilization Surgery/ Excision** and interposition - poor outcomes with nearly 100% recurrence
    - **2. Corrective osteotomy**  at mid ulnar shaft and distal radius and fuse at 10 ° supination
- How do you do osteotomy surgery for radioulnar synostosis?
    - **Goal** = Osteotomy to fix forearm in more functional position
    - **Ramachandran** et al. JBJS 2005 case series of 6 forearms. Mean 68 ° pronation, corrected to 10 ° supination
    - Osteotomy done at mid **ulnar** shaft with retrograde flexible nail inserted via olecranon (only one nail); **Radial** osteotomy at the distal diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction through a volar approach
    - Arm **supinated to 10 °**. Above elbow cast applied with elbow flexed to 90 °.
    - Cast converted to below elbow at 3 weeks and wire removed. Below elbow cast for further 3 weeks
- What angle do we correct it to?
    - **Controversial**. Ramachandran et al. JBJS 2005 advocates 10 degrees supination in all cases, whether unilateral or bilateral. All patients were pleased with position

    - Non Op - pain usually subsides by maturity
    - **Op - 3 main groups of surgery**
        - 1. Prevent deformity in young patient (**physis open**)
            - Vicker's ligament release with epiphysiodesis of unfused physis with fat interposition (of the radial dorsal aspect of distal radius)
            - OR complete epiphysiodesis of the whole distal radius
        - 2. Decrease pain and improve ROM in mature patient (**fused physis**)
            - Radius osteotomy +/- address ulnar abutment
            - Management of Chronic, Degenerative TFCC/ Unlar Abutment Syndrome?
                - **"Offloading procedures"**
                - < 2mm ulnar positive = **Wafer** procedure
                    - Removal of cartilage and bone under the TFCC
                - > 2mm ulnar positive = ulnar **shortening**
                - **Salvage** Procedures - if OA changes and pain
                    - Darrach, Sauve-kapandji, Bower’s hemiresection
                    - **Resection** of distal ulna - Darrach's
                    - **Arthrodesis** of DRUJ with proximal pseudoarthrosis- Suave Kapanji technique
        - 3. **Salvage procedures with fusion**
            - Wrist fusion
