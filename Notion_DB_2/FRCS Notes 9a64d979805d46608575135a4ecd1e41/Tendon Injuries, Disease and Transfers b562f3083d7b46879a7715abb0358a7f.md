### Tendon transfer Principles

- How do you connect tendon to tendon?
    - Tendon weaving technique (Pulvertaft)
    - Minimum of 3 weaves
- Complications of tendon transfer?
    - Motor failure - poor motor education and inadequate donor strength
    - Mobility failure - scar or joint contracture
    - Excursion failure - poor tensioning
    - Technical failure - rupture of tendon weave
    - Most common is due to adhesions
- What are the principles of tendon transfer?
    - Total **9 S**
        - **Joint** - no joint contractures (**S**upple joint)
        - **Bed** - no infection (a**S**eptic bed)
        - **Donor** - 8S - **S**trong donor (grade 4 or 5 as it will drop one grade), **S**acrificable Donor, **S**ufficient length/ amplitude (Smith's 3-5-7 rule), **S**ynergistic (fire in concert with paralyzed muscles), **S**traight line Pull, **S**ingle tendon for single function.
        - **Patient -** good compliance to PT (**S**uitable Patient)
    - ***Smith 3-5-7*** =
        - **3cm for wrist** flexor and extensor
        - **5cm** - Finger extensors
        - **7cm** - Finger flexors

### Flexor Tendon Injuries

- What is the anatomy of the flexor tendon?
    - FDS and FDP
    - FDP pierces the FDS at the Campers Chiasm at P1
    - FDP then inserts in distal phalanx
    - FDS inserts into middle phalanx
    
    ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled.png)
    
- What is the main nutrition source of tendons?
    - Main supply is **extrinsic** imbibition (diffusion) of nutrients from synovial fluid within the sheath
    - Also by intrinsic **vinicular** from digital artery branches
- How do you describe level of amputation/ flexor tendon injury?
    - **Verdan's** zones:
    - 1 = Distal to FDS (only FDP injured)
    - 2 = FDS to A1 pulley (no man's land)
    - 3 = A1 to CT
    - 4 = CT
    - 5 = proximal to CT
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%201.png)
        
- What are the flexor tendon repair principles?
    - Goal is to provide **sufficient strength** to allow mobilization, minimize gap and adhesion formation. Aim for low tension, minimal suture materials.
    - Brunner's approach
    - Retrieve retracted tendons by Milking proximal end distally
        - If fail, make transverse incision at level of distal palmar crease, proximal to A1 pulley
        - Pass a catheter from distal to proximal wound; attach catheter to tendon and pull through
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Repair with **6 core** + epitendinous sutures
        - Avoid bunching, avoid gap
    - Tendon gapping is a hall mark of tendon repair failure (> 2mm)
    - Post op splint in **intrinsic plus** position
- What suture will you use?
    - Suture material - usually **non absorbable**, monofilament material
    - Suture size -4/0 for core, 6/0 for epitendinous suture
- What are features of an ideal repair?
    - Secure knots
    - **Smooth** junction of tendon ends
    - Minimal gapping
    - Minimal interference with tendon vascularity
    - Sufficient strength
    - Pulleys preserved - A2 and A4 must be preserved to prevent bowstringing
- Significance of **zone 2** flexor tendon injury?
    - Both FDP and FDS tendons are cut
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%203.png)
        
- What are the options for **zone 2** injuries?
    - 1. Repair of FDP tendon only , debride FDS
    - 2. Repair of both tendons may be technically demanding. FDS tendon may be retracted
    - 3. Repair of FDP with one slip of FDS tendon(most surgeons repair FDP and 1 slip of FDS)
- Significance of **zone 3** flexor tendon injury?
    - Here, the NV bundle is superficial than the tendons. So if tendons cut, means NV surely cut
    - Few studies on zone 3 injuries
    - FDS is more superficial.
    - Deep palmar arch may be injured (along Kaplan's line) ➔ can be treated with ligation
    - A1 pulley may need to be released to retrieve distal stump
    - Carpal Tunnel may need to be released to retrieve proximal stump (Most patients need both released)
    - However, **Zone 3 are more ‘forgiving’ because the tendons do not run in a fibroosseous tunnel** and hence resistance during motion is less and one can afford to repair both the superficialis and profundus tendons using a bulky repair.
- What if repair is bulky and is unable to glide?
    - RENITA - Exam just say keep both A2 and A4 pulley to prevent bowstringing
    - **Venting/ incision of A2 and A4** pulley
    - Studies show that A4 pulley can be entirely vented while A2 pulley can be vented over 1/2 to 2/3 of its length
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%204.png)
        
- Draw a 6 core tendon repair?
    - Classic Lim and Tsai requires 2 x looped sutures, with the knot within the laceration itself
    - Core purchase - 1cm (<0.4cm poor outcomes)
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - Modified Lim and Tsai technique uses 1 loop sutures with knots out of the laceration
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%206.png)
        
- ‼️ What are Flexor tendon **rehab principles**?
    - I am aware of 2 rehab protocols
        - **1. Complete Immobilization** suitable for young children (cast for 1 month), cannot cooperate
        - **2. Early controlled active motion** - place and hold with dorsal blocking splint for 6/52 then AROM
            - Start with passive flexion, **terminal holding** and active extension in the dorsal blocking splint(*Focusing on Low force high excursion*) ➔ progress to active flexion in 6/52
    - Tendon weakest at 1-2 weeks during inflammation phase
    - Currently accepted is “Early active protocol with dorsal blocking splint”
- Principles of tendon reconstruction?
    - O**ptions are 1 stage vs 2 stage**. Gold standard is 2 stage, but most commonly 1 stage now
    - **Choice of grafts** - most common is palmaris longus; can use allograft
- ‼️ **How will you repair the tendons? [Commonly Zone 2]**
    - Principles divided into 5 parts - approach, retrieval, repair, closure and post op rehab
    - **Approach** - I will use a zig zag Brunner's incision down to flexor sheath, and enter sheath with a L shaped incision to repair at the end
    - **Retrieval** -
        - Next I will find the tendon ends by looking for the **hematoma**
        - **flexing** ahd fingers and **milking** the palm.
        - I will use a **blue needle to spike the tendon** to prevent retraction; also to minimize handling to avoid adhesion formation
        - May need to **vent** pulleys to retrieve tendon is
    - **Repair**
        - Zone 2 = options are FDP only, FDP + 1 FDS slip or all 3.
        - I will use **6/0 for epitendnous**, and **4/0 for core**. [What suture will you use?](https://workflowy.com/#/492849a60e0a)
        - I will aim for the features of ideal repair - secure, smooth, minimal gap, and preserve pulleys, minimal handling.
        - If it is too bulky, i will consider partial venting of A2 and A4 pulleys
    - **Closure** - close flexor tendon sheath and then close skin
    - **Post op** -
        - Splint in Intrinsic plus position.
        - Refer hand therapist for Early CAM - dorsal blocking splint, place and hold. If this is a child, I will put on a boxing glove bulky dressing and no movement for 3-4 weeks (knowing that the first 1-2 weeks is weakest) [What are the stages of tendon healing? When is it weakest?](https://workflowy.com/#/c2fe3088dc09)

### JERSEY FINGER (❌ )

- What is jersey finger?
    - It is a Verdan type 1 flexor tendon injury involving the FDP tendon
- Where is the blood supply to the finger tendon?
    - Each tendon (FDP and FDS) has 2 viniculae - longus and brevis
    - For the FDP tendon - reference for Jersey finger
        - Viniculae **Brevis** is at A4
        - Viniculae **Longus** is at A2
    
    ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - Longus is always proximal to brevis. the Brevis for superficialis coincide with longus for profundus at P1 head.
    - Vinculum Longus (S and P) at A2
    - Vinculum Brevis (S and P) at A4
- Which finger most common? Why?
    - Ring Finger most common – longest and weaker FDP insertion in cadaveric study
    - Longest finger in clenched fist position
- ‼️ What is the classification for Jersey Finger Injury?
    - **Leddy and Packer** Classification (only 1-3) + **Al Qattan** Modifications - based on extent of retraction with the corresponding injury to viniculae
    - 1 = to palm; so both viniculum longus and brevis disrupted
    - 2 = to **A3**; so only brevis disrupted
    - 3 = to **A5**; so both intact ➔ limited retraction due to **BONY avulsion**
    - 4 = **Segmental**; DFP in palm + large avulsion
    - 5 = Concomittant **P3 fracture**, FDP at A4 (good blood supply)
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%208.png)
        
- How will you assess this patient's finger?
    - Assess the injury - NV, open, weakness
    - BONUS: Check for **PL tendon** ➔ for chronic reconstruction
- Management of Jersey Finger?
    - **Acute**
        - If avulsion # - screw
        - If tendon – mini suture anchor, **dorsal button** technique
    - **Chronic**
        - If PROM limited ➔ fusion
        - If supple ➔ Tendon grafting
- What techniques of jersey finger tendon reconstruction are you aware of?
    - **Staged vs single stage**; Currently most use single staged tendon grafting
        - 1st stage = silicon rod to **dilate** pulley and reconstruct if required
        - 2nd stage = reconstruct tendon with PL graft
- Complications of Jersey finger repair/ recon?
    - **Quadriga** = Excessive advancement of FDP
    - Because FDP share common muscle belly, distal advancement in one will reduce flexion strength in adjacent digits

### FLEXOR PULLEY INJURIES  (❌ )

![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%209.png)

    - Due to bowstringing ➔ unable to achieve full finger flexion to distal palmar crease
- What is the incidence?
    - 75% of all rock climbers get UL injury > 60% affect hand and wrist > 50% affect flexor tendon pulley system.
    - 8% incidence of A2 pulley rupture
- What is the grading for flexor pulley injuries?
    - Grade 1 = strain only
    - Grade 2 = partial rupture
    - Grade 3 = Complete rupture
    - Grade 4 = concomittant collateral ligament or lumbrical muscle rupture
- Management of flexor pulley rupture?
    - **Acutely** - conservative.
        - **Primary repair is not effective.**
        - External tape or rings to reduce bowstringing [most will be successfully treated conservatively]

    - EDC crosses dorsum of **MCPJ**, stabilized by the extensor hood, consisting of the **transverse**, **oblique** and **sagittal** bands
    - Divides into 3 slips at the expansion hood
        - Central slip continues on to insert onto **middle phalanx**
        - 2 lateral bands travel on either side of proximal and middle phalanx to insert on **distal phalanx**
    - 3 ligaments in the extensor mechanism
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%2017.png)
        
        - **Triangular** ligament - between the 2 lateral slips on **dorsum**; prevent palmar subluxation [contracts in chronic swan neck/ attenuates in boutonierre] - [‼️ Pathophysiology of boutonnieres?](HRM%20Arthritis%20-%20OA,%20RA,%20AVN%20(Kienbock),%20Deformitie%2072b610f2ee1b43809bdfd8dc5c31c399.md)
        - **Transverse** retinacular ligament - between the 2 lateral slips on palmar; prevents dorsal subluxation [contracts in chronic boutonierre/ attenuates in swan neck]
        - **Oblique** retinacular ligament - bilateral strong narrow bands from A2 pulley to base of extensor tendon
    - Juncturae tendinum -

    - Dependant on the zone
    - **Zone 1,2** = Immobilization in mallet splint
    - **Zone 3,4** = **Short arc motion splint** (basically volar splint to limit flexion to allow short arc motion)
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%2019.png)
        
    - **Zone 5-6** = immediate Controlled Active Motion (CAM) with CAM splint aka **Yoke splint** aka relative motion splint
        
        ![Untitled](Tendon%20Injuries,%20Disease%20and%20Transfers%20b562f3083d7b46879a7715abb0358a7f/Untitled%2020.png)
        
        - Allows full composite active motion of uninjured digits but allows 10-15 ° less MP flexion to the digit with repaired tendon
    - **Zone 7, 8** = Immobilization

### MALLET FINGER

- ‼️ Classification of mallet finger?

        - **Primary Lesion:** Volar plate laxity at PIPJ ➔ hyperextension of PIPJ by central slip ➔ **FDP** pulls DIPJ flexed ➔ Attenuation of the transverse retinacular ligament on volar side ➔ **Lateral bands** sublux dorsally and worsen hyperextension
        - **Secondary Lesion** leads to imbalance of forces on PIPJ with PIPJ extension forces greater than PIPJ forces
            - [MCPJ] **volar** subluxation in RA due to synovitis
            - [PIPJ] **FDS** rupture ➔ unopposed PIPJ extension with subsequent attenuation of transverse retinacular ligaments
            - [DIPJ] **Mallet** injury ➔ due to attrition of terminal tendon, extension forces now go thru central slip that attaches to base of middle phalanx, **leading to hyperextension at PIPJ**
- Management of Chronic mallet finger?
    - Stiff finger = fusion
    - Flexible = reconstruction of Spiral Oblique Retinacular Ligament

        - **3b,** unable to actively flex - patient unable to flex fully even with passive force.
        - 4 = **fixed** flexion
- Management?
    - Splint
    - H and L (60% success)
    - Surgical release
        - LA, Longitudinal incision over A1 pulley
        - Be careful of A2 pulley to prevent bowstringing

### DeQuervain’s

- What are the extensor compartments of the hand?
    - 6 compartments. 2 and 3 divided by the Lister's tubercle

    - ECRL to base of 2nd MC, ECRB to based of 3rd MC

    - Note the **Listers tubercle** helps us to determine the 2 and 3rd compartments easily
- What is DeQuervain's?
    - Stenosing tenosynovial inflammation of 1st dorsal compartment
    - Having said that, histological studies by Clarke in 1998, did not find inflammation but myxoid degeneration, thus it is possible that the disease is a result of intrinsic degenerative mechanicsms rather than inflammatory ones. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9888670/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9888670/)
- What could be predisposing factors for De Quervain's?
    - **Extrinsic** = over use,
    - **Intrinsic** = anatomical variants:
        - Multiple APL tendons and EPB subsheath are more common in patients with DQ than general population
        - Women more common then male
- What are the clinical tests?
    - **Finkelstein** [EXAMINER PULL] - use hand to adduct thumb and ulnar deviate wrist to put tension on APL and EPB (1st Extensor compartment).

    - **Eichoff** - Patient ownself pull using clenched fist

- Management?
    - Non op – PT/ Splint/ infection
    - Op – release of 1st compartment
- What are the 2 pitfalls in surgery?
    - Danger - SRN
    - Recurrence due to failure to recognize separate subsheath of EPB/ APL
- How can we know Intra-operatively that there is a EPB subsheath?
    - EPB is supposed to be a MCPJ joint extensor as it attaches to the Proximal phalanx base

    - A cadaveric and clinical study found that if the EPB was able to extend the thumb IPJ, 88% of the time, it is in its own separate subsheath! it means the EPB tendon is attached to Distal phalanx or the extensor hood.

### Snapping ECU

- What is it?
    - Rupture of the ECU sub sheath
    - Frequent in rowers and drummers
- What test?
    - ECU Synergy test
        - Elbow flexed to 90 on table, Forearm in full supination and ulnar deviation ➔ Can visualize or palpate tendon
        - Can further accentuate the tendon by having the patient ulnar deviate against resistance

- Management
    - Non op – splint
    - Op – ECU subsheath recon with extensor retinaculum flap + deepening of groove
