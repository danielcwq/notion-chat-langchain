- What is an orthoses?
    - Device that is externally attached to improve function by supporting weak muscles or compensating and correcting skeletal deformity
- What is an ideal Orthosis?
    - Should be effective, lightweight, cosmetically acceptable, easy to put on and take off, and comfortable.
- How can you classify orthotics?
    - Corrective vs Accomodative
        - **Corrective** - hard and limits motion e.g. rocker shoe
        - **Accomodative** - soft to allow shock absorption to accomodate fixed deformities
    - Sometimes, the same orthothic can be **both**. E.g. TLSO can support fracture but also correct scoliosis.
- What are the are the different plastics?
    - Thermosetting vs Thermoforming
    - **Thermosetting** - pliable above certain temperature; return to solid on cooling. Very durable. cannot be reshaped.
    - **Thermoforming** - can be reshaped by reheating at various temperatures
- How does it work?
    - By three-point pressure principle
    - Or in certain braces e.g. Jack's Brace, 4-points

- What is the difference between posterior leaf spring orthoses vs solid ankle foot orthosis?
    - Posterior leaf spring - **trim line** is behind malleolus
    - AFO - trim line is infront of malleolus - more rigid to overcome spasticity
    - Hinged AFO - to allow some degree of PF

## Clubfoot brace

![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%201.png)

- What is this?

- What are the 5 key features of the **FAO**?
    - **5 key words** ; "Open toe, high top, straight lass shoes at shoulder width, attached to a bar"

## GRAFO

- What is this? How does it work?
    - GRAFO - ground reaction ankle and foot orthosis
    - It is a **static** and **corrective** orthosis made of **theromsetting plastic** that is durable
    - it has a rigid toe plate, rigid ankle in neutral and a rigid anterior tibial shell
- How Does the GRAFO work?
    - DRAFO = Ground Reaction Ankle Foot Orthoses
    - **"GRAFO works by keeping the knee extended with the anterior tibial shell and preventing ankle dorsiflexion; keeping the GRF in front of the knee in the presence of weak quads and gastroc. "**
        
        ![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - It works by controlling the distal joints to affect more proximal joints, a concept known as **coupling**
    - Used in Crouch Gait in CP
    - In the **second rocker of the gait,** whilst the GRF is going from posterior to anterior of the knee, the quads are usually strong enough to prevent excessive flexion of the knee.
        
        ![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%204.png)
        
        - In A - However, in quads or gastroc weakness, there is excessive dorsiflexion and knee flexion ➔ Knee thus buckles and patient is unable to walk
        - In C - Anterior tibial shell prevents excessive ankle dorsiflexion, thus GRF is kept in front of the knee, helping with knee extension for weak quads
- What is an AFO similar to GRAFO used in Polio patients?
    
    ![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - Satiel ankle foot orthosis was first developed in 1969 for polio patients with quadriceps weakness. it is the first ground reaction force orthoses but it has a fixed equinus. Thus it is only suitable for single leg use and require walking aids
    - "Because of these limitations and because many cerebral palsy patients require bilateral application, we modified the Saltiel design to use with these children. The principal differences in design include a shorter proximal trimline and an angulation at the ankle which we determine for each patient.

## UCBL

![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%206.png)

- What is this (UCBL)?
    - This is UCBL orthosis (University of California Berkeley Laboratories). It is a **rigid** plastic insert used to control severe hind foot valgus and midfoot pronation (used in PTTD)
    - It is a **corrective** orthosis
    - Designed to maintain the hindfoot in neutral position, **locking the transverse tarsal** joints and limiting pronation (essentially takes over the job of posterior tibial tendon to lock the transverse tarsal joint)
    

## Boston Brace

![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%207.png)

- What is this?
    - This is a boston brace used to treat pediatric scoliosis
    - Works on principle of 3 point fixation

## Milwaukee Brace

![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%208.png)

- What is this?
    - this is a milwaukee brace aka CLTSO - has a head collar
    

## Plaster of Paris

![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%209.png)

- ‼️What is plaster of Paris?
    - It is anhydrous calcium **sulfate**
        - [Remember as opposite in bone Substitute. Preferred bone substitute is calcium phosphate. this is calcium sulfate]
    - Why paris? - large **gypsum** deposite at Montmarte in Paris
- How is POP made?
    - Gypsum is calcium **sulfate** dihydrate
    - It is heated to 150 ° to become anhydrous calcium sulfate
    
    ![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    - Ground to fine powder and bonded to gauze
    - When being used, it is mixed with water to form calcium sulphate dihydrate again (exothermic reaction)
    
    ![Untitled](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5/Untitled%2011.png)
    
- What happens when water is added?
    - “Exothermic Reaction due to **Latent Heat Crystallization**”
    - Anhydrous calcium sulphate is rehydrated
- Why must it be mixed with gauze?
    - Gypsum alone is brittle and weak
    - Mix with mesh that is ductile ➔ confers improved properties in the 2D plane of the mesh but not in compression of the surface of cast (anisotropic)
- What factors can you control to make it harden faster?
    - Use thinner plaster of paris
    - Use water of higher temperature
    - Less Water
- What is fiberglass?
    - It is **polyurethane resin** made of plastic matrix and fine fibers of glass
    - Produced by melting silica, clay and other materials
- POP vs fiberglass?
    - **Fiber glass** is stronger as it has a 3D lattice; it is lighter and improved water resistance and endurance
        - But less easily moulded, more expensive, no give (thus not used in immediate setting)
        - More radioluscent on XR - better for follow up
    - **POP** - more easily moulded, cheaper
- What influences the risk of heat injury? Which cast will be at risk?
    - Number of layers
    - Ventilation
    - Most risky are hip spica which requires large amount of POP around groin and thighs with minimal ventilation.
