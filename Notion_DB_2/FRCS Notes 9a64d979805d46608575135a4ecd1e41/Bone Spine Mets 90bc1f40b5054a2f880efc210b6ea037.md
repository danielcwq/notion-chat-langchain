## General

- What are the common mets to spine/ bone? (what to examine)
    - Diamond - Thyroid, **Breast**, kidney, lung, **Prostate**
- Which mets are typically blastic?
    - Prostate, Breast, Transtional cell carcinoma (urological), medullary thyroid cancer (papillary, which is more common is lytic)
- What investigations?
    - Bloods
        - FBC, ESR,CRP, Renal panel, calcium, ALP, LDH, myeloma panel
        - ALP ‚ûî Osteoblastic activity
        - LDH ‚ûî Osteoclastic activity
        - Tumor markers (if suspected; not all the time)- CEA (colon, pancreas)/ CA 125 (ovarian)/ PSA (prostate)
    - Initial XR - entire bone, entire spine
    - Advanced imaging geared towards local and systemic staging -
        - CTTAP
        - MRI with Contrast
        - Bone scan
    - Biopsy - Open vs CT guided
- Special ****investigation for Spine Mets?
    - CT guided biopsy
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è What is the pathophysiology of metastasis?
    - Primary tumor cells proliferate
    - 1. Cross basement membrane into capillaries via **CADHERIN E Cell adhesion molecules** and
    - 2. Enter blood streams and **disseminate** to distant sites
    - 3. Cells adhere to **vascular endothelium** via **INTEGRINS**,
    - 4. **extravasate** into endorgan
    - 5. Stimulatees **angiogenesis** via **VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factors)**
    - 6. Tumor cells produce cytokines that stimulate osteoblasts/ osteoclasts
        - Some produce **RANKL** ‚ûî activate **osteoclasts**
        - Some produce **Endothelin** 1 ‚ûî activates **osteoblasts** [e.g](http://e.gl/) prostate

## SPINE METS

- How will you assess this patient with suspected Spine Mets? #üìú
    - Ascertain source (PE and history check diamond)
    - History assess for pain - also for SINS score
    - Invx - ‚Äúgeared towards assessing the patient based on the proposed NOMS framework proposed by Bilsky et al.‚Äù
- How much bone involvement must there be to be seen on XR?
    - 30-50% bone is destroyed

- What is the difference in MRI for Infection vs Tumor vs TB?
    - **Infection** - disc involvement + rim enhancing lesion.
    - **TB** - cold abscess spreading across ALL with PRESERVED disc with paraspinal absccess
    - **Tumor** - PRESERVED disc, T1 also reduced signal due to loss of bone marrow from tumor infiltration (fatty bone marrow is replaced by cancer cells)

- What is the pathogenesis of Hematogenous spread mets/ infection/ TB to spine? Usually which part affected first?
    - Due to **valveless venous system of Batson‚Äôs**  Found **within the spinal canal**
    - The **spinal** veins, **pelvic** and **thoracic** veins drain into the batson‚Äôs plexus which is valveless
    - ‚ûî  Seeding at **end plate** where there are "low flow vascular anastamoses" ‚ûî  infection spread across endplate ‚ûî  Spread to VB

    - Usually going to **vertebral body first** then pedicles (so affects **MOTOR** first)
        - So we get the Tuli‚Äôs 5 stages of Pott‚Äôs Paralysis
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What is your initial management for spine mets?
    - Immediate institute IV Dexamethasone 16mg if any cord involvement based on the NICE guidelines
    - [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg75/resources/metastatic-spinal-cord-compression-in-adults-risk-assessment-diagnosis-and-management-pdf-975630102469](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg75/resources/metastatic-spinal-cord-compression-in-adults-risk-assessment-diagnosis-and-management-pdf-975630102469)
    - Cord compression ‚ûî IV **16mg Dexamethasone** loading dose ‚ûî **16mg OM** while treatment is being planned ‚ûî tail down after OP or RT over 5-7 days
    - If no op or RT (i.e. palliative), gradually tail down dose as well.

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è What is your definitive management? Any framework?
    - I utilize the NOMS frame work to guide my treatment by Bilksy et al. in 2013
    - It incorporates the Neurologic, Oncologic, mechanical and systemic considerations to facilitate decision making

- How do you assess the **Neurological** component?
    - Assessing the degree of epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC)
    
    ![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - I can use the Bilsky scoring system
        - **Grade 0** = **bone only** disease (A)
        - **Grade 1** = encroach into spinal canal or epidural sac but No cord compression
        - **Grade 2**, **spinal cord compression**, but with cerebrospinal fluid (**CSF) visible around the cord**. (E)
        - **Grade 3**, spinal cord compression, **no CSF visible around the cord.**¬†(F)
    - Grades 2, 3 = High grade ESCC
- How do you assess the **Oncologic** component?
    - This looks at the **responsiveness** of the tumor to radiation
    - Considered radiosensitive or resistant based on response to cEBRT
        - **Radiosensitive, Non-Solid tumors** - Lymphoma, seminoma, and myeloma
        - **Radiosensitive Solid tumors** - Breast, prostate, Ovary **BPO**
        - **Radioresistant Solid tumors** - Renal, thyroid, hepatocellular, colon and non-small-cell lung carcinomas, sarcoma, melanoma
    - Based on the NOMS framework:
        - **Radiosensitive tumors -**  may be treated with cEBRT regardless of the ESCC grade.
        - **Radioresistant tumors WITHOUT high grade ESCC** - High dose SBRT without surgical decompression (already has space) ‚ûî *unless progression*
        - Radioresistant tumors WITH high grade ESCC - Separation surgery and stablization
- How do you assess the **Mechanical** component?
    - Mechanical instability represents an **independent** indication for surgical stabilization or percutaneous cement augmentation, **regardless** of the ESCC grade and radiosensitivity of the tumor.
    - Assess with the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) - 6 things
        - location, pain, lesion type, alignment, collapse, posterolateral involvement
        - **>12 unstable** out of 18
        
        ![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%204.png)
        
- How do you assess the **Systemic** component?
    - All treatment decisions are predicated on the patient's ability to tolerate the proposed intervention based on the extent of systemic comorbidities and tumor burden.
    - NOMS recommend discussion with patient's oncologist
    - Can use **Tokuhashi** score - based on 6 things
        - general condition, number of extraspinal mets, number of spine mets, resectability of mets to internal organs, primary site, neurology
        
        ![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%205.png)
        
- What tumors will you consider Pre-op angioembolization?
    - Consider for vascular tumors e.g. **RCC** and **Thyroid**

- Any landmark paper for Spinal mets?
    - Lancet 2005 RCT by Patchell, Patients with metastatic Ca **with cord compression** -
        - RT only vs Surgery + RT
        - Found that patients with surgery r**etained ability to walk** longer than those with RT only (122 days v 13).
    - Most of the patients had radioresistant tumors other than those with **breast** and **prostate** CA.
- What approaches?
    - **"Posterior transpedicular Approach" -** decompress through pedicles
    - Laminectomy
    - Bilateral facetectomies and complete pedicle resection to the base of the vertebral body
        
        ![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%206.png)
        
- Management of Oligometastatic disease?
    - Aim for **curative** - for solitary renal/ thyroid mets
    - Total Enbloc Spondylecotomy (TES) and reconstruction with cage
    - Strut materials - PMMA/ Cage/ Allograft
- What is SBRT?
    - Stands for Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)
    - Conventional Exeternal beam radiotherapy (cEBRT) delivers wide-field radiation
    - SBRT - delivering high dose of radiation to tumor while minimising radiation dose to surrounding tissue e.g. Spinal Cord
    - But technically and logistically heavy as require much planning
- What is separation surgery?
    - Made possible with SBRT technology
    - SBRT is less effective when delivered to tumors causing spinal cord compression
    - Goal is to create distance **1-2mm** between tumor and spinal cord via single-stage posterolateral transpedicular approach and then allow SBRT to target tumor.
- How to reduce wound complications post op?
    - Begin RT **minimum 7 day**s, **optimally after 2 weeks** (Naresh Kumar et al. 2020 European Spine Journal Systematic review)
- Aware of PEEK and carbon implants?
    - + good for post op MRI radio planning
    - (-) not easy to contour the rods

## LONG BONE METS

- ‚ö†Ô∏è What is the Mirel's score?
    - Based on 4 things - location, pain, matrix and size
    - Prophylactic nail if ‚â• 9
    
    ![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%207.png)
    
- What scenarios?
    - **Known bone mets** ‚ûî Fix
    - **Known cancer but no known bone mets** ‚ûî Restage with local imaging, open biopsy, frozen section to confirm it is mets and not new primary before fixation
    - **No known cancer** ‚ûî diagnostic investigations, local and systemic staging, open biopsy, frozen section to confirm it is mets and not new primary before fixation
    
    ![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%208.png)
    
- Role of frozen section?
    - Important in confirming that it is not a primary bone tumor
    - Frozen section on table
        - If carcinoma (and not sarcoma) ‚ûî proceed with long nail
        - If suspicious of bone primary (sarcoma) ‚ûî abort as will need to consider limb salvage or limb preserving op
- Special technique for nails?
    - Use of vent holes ‚Äì to reduce Intramedullary pressure to reduce risk of fat emboli
    - Typically done with 4.5mm drill at distal cortex of femur

## CASE: PATHOLOGICAL FRACTURE

![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%209.png)

- How will you evaluate and manage this patient if **no history of cancer**?
    - Triple assessment - history, Bloods and further imaging TRO Pathological fracture
    - **Hx and PE** - prodromal pain, symptoms, LOW, LOA. HISTORY OF CANCER? KNOWN mets? Examine for - breast lump, chest lesion, thyrpoid, prostate.
    - **Bloods** (also TRO infection) - FBC, CRP, ESR, Ca Panel, ALP, LDH, +/- myeloma panel
    - **Local imaging** - MRI whole bone with contrast
    - if MRI + for pathological fracture ‚ûî **CTTAP**, **Bone scan t**o look for primary.
    - Plus MDT discussion
- How will you evaluate this patient with **history of cancer but unknown mets?**
    - **Triple assessment to evaluate for mets and imaging for re-staging**
    - Hx - worsening symptoms, follow up, compliance with chemotherapy
    - Bloods - same
    - Local imaging - MRI whole bone with contast
    - Re-staging - CTTAP, Bone scan
- **How do you manage this fracture after workup?**
    - Will need histological diagnosis to confirm this is mets and not a primary bone tumor
    - Intraop frozen section ‚ûî confirm this is **carcinoma**
        - If **unresectable carcinoma mets** ‚ûî fix
        - If **resectable** carcinoma (**RCC/ Breast**) ‚ûî MDT for excision, shortening and fixation
        - If **sarcoma** ‚ûî Stop op. MDT for curative surgery. Salvage vs Amputation

## Case: Open pathological fracture

![Untitled](Bone%20Spine%20Mets%2090bc1f40b5054a2f880efc210b6ea037/Untitled%2010.png)

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è What are your considerations and approach to open pathological fracture?
    - 1. Treat open fracture and trauma
    - 2. Attain temporary stability
    - 3. Histological diagnosis
    - 4. Definitive treatment
- 1. Treat open fracture
    - I will start by ensuring patient stable ATLS, Antibiotics
    - Temp back slab for stability and MRI scan. In my institution, i can get the scan fairly quickly
    - Thereafter, can discuss with MSO surgeon to plan for biopsy and debridement of wound. Wound can be extended longitudinally, do a intracompartmental approach, careful not to expose NV
    - Drain
- **2. Ex fix for temporary stability while waiting for definitive treatment**
- 3. Complete work up after ex fix- local and systemic staging
- 4. MDT to decide curative or palliative
    - Curative - wide excision vs amputation
    - Palliative - fixation
