Topic: Spine

- What is the **Kirkaldy Wallis Degenerative** cascade?
    - 1. **Dysfunctional** phase (4 things)  =
        
        [tear, dehydration, conversion, stiffening]
        
        - **tears** of annulus,
        - disc **dehydration** [DDD, spinal stenosis].
        - There is **conversion** of type 2 collagen to type 1 fibrocartillage ➔ **stiffening** of the Nucleus pulposus
    - 2. **Instability** - [spondylolisthesis]
    - 3. **Restabilization** = osteophyte formation, buckling of ligamentum flavum
- ⚠️ What are modic changes?
    - 3 types of modic changes described by Modic in 1988
    - **Type 1** = Hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 (bone marrow edema)
        
        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - **Type 2** Hyperintense on **both** T1 and T2 = conversion of red hemapoietic bone marrow into yellow fatty marrow due to marrow ischemia.
        
        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - **Type 3** = Both T1 and T2 hypointense. = subchondral **sclerosis**
        
        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%205.png)
        
- Significance of Modic changes on MRI?
    - Type 1 - found to have more LBP
    - Type 1 found to have higher incidence of segmental hypermobility, unstable lesions
- What is the vacuum phenomenon?
    - Aseptic gas collection e.g. nitrogen, oxygen or CO2 within the disc
    - Closely associated with intervertebral disc degeneration, modic changes and subchondral sclerosis
    
    [Intradiscal vacuum phenomenon and spinal degeneration: a cross-sectional analysis of 219 subjects - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34663160/)
    
- 3 Key points in history?
    - Red flags
    - Neurogenic vs vascular claudication - 3 points
        - Bench to bench vs lamp to lamp
        - Pain relieved in dependant position
        - Neurogenic better when climbing stairs
    - Cauda Equina!
- ‼️ What is the basis of neurogenic claudication?
    - 2 pathophysiology = ischemia and mechanical compression
    - **Ischemia**
        - Increased compression leads to reduced spinal canal volume ➔ venous congestion ➔ diminished arterial flow to nerves
        - Walking exacerbates oxygen demand
    - **Mechanical compression**
        - Direct nerve root compression
        - Worse when spine in extension due to buckling of ligamentum flavum

- Location of Spinal stenosis? (also for disc)
    - CLFE
    - **Central** stenosis - will hit traversing roots
    - **Lateral recess aka subarticular** = begins at the medial border of the superior articular process and extends to the medial border of the pedicle - will hit traversing roots aka **" paracentral"** when used to describe disc
    - **Foraminal recess [Mid-zone]**  = between medial and lateral border of pedicles - hit exiting roots
    - **Extra-foraminal/ Far lateral recess [Exit zone]** = lateral to lateral border of pedicle - exitting roots

        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%201.png)
        
- On the MRI axial cut, which is the SAP?
    - It is the process anteriorly

- How do you classify spinal stenosis? **Causes?**
    - By anatomical location
    - By Etiology
        - **Congenital** - achondroplasia, scoliosis (neuromuscular, idiopathic…), kyphosis
        - **Degeneration** - OA, DISH, Spondylolisthesis
        - **Metabolic** - Paget’s disease
- ‼️ What are the types of spinal injections?
    - **Selective** nerve root blocks
        - Low injectate volumes (0.5–0.6 mL) to reduce inadvertent spread to other roots.
        - Aim to inject extra-foraminal area to prevent spread to avoid targeting traversing nerve roots
        - Mainly diagnostic in nature
    - **Transforminal** Epidural injection
        - Injection is within foramen = want it to spread over area and also target traversing nerve roots
        - 2 methods:
            
            ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%206.png)
            
            - **Kambin's triangle** = **aim above pedicle**.
                - If want to target L5 nerve root, aim above the L5 pedicle (

                - Triangle made up of the exiting nerve root as the hypotenuse, traversing nerve root as the height and the proximal vertebral end plate as the base.
                    
                    ![Screenshot 2022-06-23 at 5.08.20 PM.png](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Screenshot_2022-06-23_at_5.08.20_PM.png)
                    
            - **Subpedicular** approach = aim below the pedicle. (If want to target L5 nerve root, aim below the L5 pedicle)
                
                [arm-35-833.pdf](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/arm-35-833.pdf)
                
    - **Interlaminal** Epidural injection
        - injection is usually midline and placed directly between two vertebrae (similar to the approach a woman undergoes during labor for epidural anesthesia)
        
        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%207.png)
        
- Non operative management?
    - Physio, analgesia, Neuromodulators - Gabapentin

- What do you know about the SPORT trial?
    - Stand for: Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial
    - A multicenter RCT over 13 centers; comparing op vs Non op for **Spinal stenosis with and without Spondylolisthesis** involving patients published in NEJM 2008 and JBJS in 2009
    - "Found that when undergo as treated analysis, Surgery gave better outcomes for both conditions"
    - "Aware of criticisms - high loss to follow up (64% left), high cross over rates, no standardized surgery (fuse or no fuse) or non op"
    - **Results - Spinal Stenosis without Listhesis**
        - Surgery is decompressive laminectomy only
        - Intention to treat analysis – no difference
        - As treated Analysis – surgery better for all outcomes
        - SPORT no listhesis.pdf
    - **Results - SS with Spondylolisthesis**
        - Intention to treat analysis – no difference
        - As treated analysis – Surgery better than non op at 2 year and 4 year
        - SPORT with listhesis.pdf
    - **Results for discectomy**
        - High cross over - 50% of those to surgery did not have surgery, 30% of non op received surgery
        - ITT analysis - no difference
        - ATT - Surgery greater improvement in outcome measures for 4 and 8 years
    - Criticisms of SPORT trial
        - **No consistent surgical mx** as it can be decompression alone, + fusion or even instrumentation (for spondylolisthesis)
        - No specific protocol for non Op mx
        - **Very high cross over** rates. Only 33% randomized to op underwent op; 43% randomized to non-op underwent op!
        - **High drop out rate with only 64% remaining** at 8 year mark
- ‼️ Decompression vs Decompression and Fusion?
    - No consensus in literature. No role for routine fusion unless presence of spondylolisthesis
        - For fusion: Ghogawala NEJM RCT of 66 patients with **stable grade 1 spondylolisthesis.** Re-operation for fusion was 14% vs 34%. but no significant improvement in function. Higher cost and longer surgery
        - Not for Fusion: Peter Forsth et al. 247 patients stratified randomized with or without presence of spondylolisthesis. Found that with or without spondylolisthesis, fusion did not result in better clinical outcomes at 2 or 5 years.
    - In my practice, I will
        - Fuse when presence of dynamic instability (flex extend views, facet fluid) or axial back pain present
        - OR iatrogenic decompression resulting in instability (complete laminectomy OR excision > 50% of facet joints)

- What is the Waddell Non-organic signs?
    - 5 categories and 8 non organic tests
    - Categories - tenderness, simulation, distration, regional disturbance, over-reaction
    
    Canon of DORTS
    D - distraction - SLR in sitting/ standing is different
    O - over reaction - facial expression
    R - Regional - non dermatomal sensory loss or patchy weakness
    T - tender - even skin
    S - stimulated - axial load head, rotation

- What is the significance of Waddell signs?
    - 3 or more signs = non organic back pain but DOES NOT equate to malingering
    - Should do more comprehensive testing

### DISCOGRAPHY

- What is discography? What is normal?
    - Diagnostic test; Radio-opaque dye injected into disc under fluoroscopic guidance
    - In **normal** disc, dye remains in nucelus and appears as a 'cotton ball'
    - In a **herniated** disc, dye outlines the fissue to or through the outer annulus
    - **Diffusely degenerated** disc - contrast spreads throughout the disc and disc space may appear narrow on lateral radiography
        
        ![Untitled](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - This can then be supplemented with a post procedure CT (CT discography)
    - Classify CT discography based on the Dallas Discogram Description
        - Grade 0 = contrast agent within normal nucleus pulposus
        - Grade 1 = agent extend radially along fissue involving inner 1/3 of AF
        - Grade 2 = agent extend to middle 1/3 of AF
        - Grade 3 = agent extent into outer 1/3 of AF
        - Grade 4 = grade 3 with involvement of more than 30 ° of disc circumference
        
        ![grade 0; grade 3; grade 4](Lumbar%20DDD,%20Spinal%20Stenosis%20fffb9dd2738e40139b50780ab125f3f9/Untitled%2010.png)
        
        grade 0; grade 3; grade 4
        
- What constitutes a positive discography?
    - **5 criteria** Based on the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) guidelines
    - 1. Pain must be similar or exactly like the patient's clinical pain "**Concordance**"
    - 2. Volume limit of **3ml** contrast
    - 3. Pressurization **no greater than 50 psi** above opening pressure
    - 4. Adjacent discs act as **controls** - painless or non concordant pain
    - 5. Radiographic image of disc must be **abnormal** from another source.

- What is the controversy behind discography?
    - It is an invasive procedure
    - Short term risks - discitis, acute disc herniation
    - Long term risks - some studies show higher rate of lumbar disc degeneration
    - Risk of post procedure discitis

## Bertolloti Syndrome

- What is Bertolloti Syndrome?
    - Back pain caused by lumbosacral transtional vertebrae (LSTV)
    - Lumbarised S1 or Sacralized L5!
- What is the classification of LSTV?
    - Castellvi Classification
