- What is a prosthesis?
    - Device that replaces the **function** or **appearance** of a missing body part
- What are the components of the Prosthesis?
    - 4 generic components - SSLT
    - 1. **Socket** = connection body part between and prosthesis
        - Fxn: protects residium, transmits forces
    - 2. **Suspension** = attachment of the socket. Can be:
        - Belts/ straps/ sleeves (elastomeric sleeves
        - Roll-on locking liners
        - Suction/ Vacuum
    - 3. **Link** = connects socket to terminal device
    - 4. **Terminal** device
        - Non energy storing
        - Energy storing
        - Motor powered
        - Specialized
- What are the 2 kinds of prosthesis?
    - Endoskeletal vs Exoskeletal

    - **Endoskeletal** - it means the structural strength is from the inner structure - metal that is not seen. It is covered with cosmetic foam. MODULAR. This is the one we use today
    - **Exoskeletal** - prosthesis gains its strength from the outer laminated shell.; parts not interchangeable. heavy and bulky
- What is an ideal stump?
    - Intra op tissue handling
        - **Nerves** sectioned cleanly under tension to prevent neuroma
        - **Bone** ends bevelled or contoured
        - **Muscle** handling - **myoplasty** (suture muscle to **perisoteum**) vs **myodesis** (direct suture of muscle to **bone**)
    - Closure
        - Cylindrical or conical shape at closure
        - Avoid excessive redundant soft tissue
        - Wound should be mobile away from bony edges, no tension
        - Skin should be sensate, avoiding SSG
- How is load transferred from prosthesis to limb? [Socket of BKA?]
    - **Direct vs indirect** load transfer
    - BKA stump is **indirect** load transfer via  Total contact ****method (more common now do distribute load)
    - This is opposed to **direct** load transfer aka end weight bearing - e.g. Patellar tendon bearing in the past

- What terminal devices do you know for a Below knee prosthesis?
    - Solid ankle cushioned Heel (SACH) = **non energy storing, non articulating device** used in patients with low energy levels as it is light in weight, cheap and little maintenance. HOWEVER, it can lead to overload, thus replaced with
        
        ![Untitled](27%20Prosthesis%20b1d708f23a0f465da581949fc817f66b/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - Single-axis foot - has a hinge that provides dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Also Non energy storing
        
        ![Untitled](27%20Prosthesis%20b1d708f23a0f465da581949fc817f66b/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Dynamic Response Foot - flexible keel that stores some energy
        
        ![Untitled](27%20Prosthesis%20b1d708f23a0f465da581949fc817f66b/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Energy storing, non articulating foot prosthesis
        
        ![Untitled](27%20Prosthesis%20b1d708f23a0f465da581949fc817f66b/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - Energy storing, **articulating hydraulic** prosthesis
        
        ![Untitled](27%20Prosthesis%20b1d708f23a0f465da581949fc817f66b/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Motor powered
- How does the SACH work?
    - It has a rigid wooden keel and compressible material in heel
    - **Compressible material in heel** ‚ûî provides shock absorption at heel contact
    - As the toe approaches the floor, the prosthetic shank rotates forwards over the foot and the heel cushion decompresses

- How does Dynamic Response Foot Work?
    - Unlike the SACH, it has a flexible keel that allows deformation under load and allows dorsiflexion, acting as a spring

- Complications of Prosthesis?
    - Stump issues
        - **Prosthesis** - pistoning, pressure, **choke** syndrome (venous stasis)
        - **Dermatological** - skin damage, blisters, ulcers
        - **Surgery** - neuroma, heterotopic ossification, lack padding
    - Patient complications
        - **Systemic** - weight gain, obesity
        - **Psychosocial** - depression, **phantom** limb pain
- Indications of a BKA?
    - Unsalvageable mangled foot
    - Severe infection
    - Tumor
- Bring me through a BKA?
    - Incision - anterior **10cm distal to TT**, 2/3 of circumference; posterior flap double anterior flap length.
    - Use diathermy to cut muscles
    - Saw bone
    - Identity and ligate and tie off NVBs (Posterior tibial NVB, Anterior tibial NVB)
    - Cut muscle with amputation knife
    - Bevel bone
    - **Myodesis** of gastroc muscle - suture to bone.
    - Drain and Tension free closure.
    - Back slab with knee in extension, pressure dressing
    - Post BKA
        - Immediate - focus on wound healing, strength training, Stump shrinker
        - Pre-prosthetic training with **PPMA** (Pneumatic post amputation mobility aid)
        - Skin-desensitization program - massage, edema control with compression, gentle tapping
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Whats the increase in metabolic cost of amputation?
    - BKA - trauma 25%, Vascular 40% more
    - Bilateral BKA 40%
    - AKA - 65%, vascular 100% more
    - Bilateral AKA 300%
- What if BKA patient develop contracture?
    - Difficult to use prosthesis
    - Serial casting has been described, aggressive stretching, surgical release
- Tell me about transfemoral AKA prosthesis?
    - Socket evolution - Conventional socket ‚ûî Ischial tuberosity bearing socket ‚ûî **Ischial ramus Containment (IRC)** socket
    - IRC sockets aims to lock onto the pelvis - medially containing the inferior pubic ramus, posterior containing the ischial tuberosity.
