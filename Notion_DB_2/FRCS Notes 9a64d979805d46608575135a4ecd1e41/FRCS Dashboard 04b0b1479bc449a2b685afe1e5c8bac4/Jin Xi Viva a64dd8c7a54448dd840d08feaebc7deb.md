    - This is severe cubital tunnel syndrome.
        - **Presence of demyelination** - as seen from velocity reduced only above elbow but not below elbow. So the lesion is somewhere at elbow
        - **Presence of axonal loss -** widespread drop in amplitude and along whole ulna
            - Amplitude, unlike conduction velocity will drop in its entirety, not just segmental drop
