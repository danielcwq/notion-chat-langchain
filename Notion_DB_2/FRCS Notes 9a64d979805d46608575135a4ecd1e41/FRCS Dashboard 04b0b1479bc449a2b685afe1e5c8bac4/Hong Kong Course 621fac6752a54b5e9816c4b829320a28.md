        - Hydorxyapatite is for bony ongrowth only. Not for bony ingrowth.
            - HA is gradually replaced by bone

        - Achieved by shaping the 2 mating parts so that there is slight deviation in size and not a line to line fit.
        - Interference refers to one part interfering with the space that the other is taking up, resulting in increased **friction** between the surfaces, leading to **stability**
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 11.40.24 AM.png](../31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Screenshot_2022-08-11_at_11.40.24_AM.png)
            
    - Why do we need a large core diameter in the locking bolt vs nail?
        - The aim of the locking bolt is to resist 4 point loading forces
        - The design thus sacrifices pull out strength with ability to tolerate bending forces as determines by the Second Moment Area (larger core diameter, smaller thread depth)
        - Bending ridigity is to the power of 4 with the diameter
    - What are bioabsorbable screws? Pros and cons?
        - Material can be Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly -L-lactic acid (PLLA) or Polyglycolic acid
            - Work by interference fit… with slight deviation in size…
            - Screw interference with the space that holds the graft and bone… increases friction… increases stability
        - **Pros** - does not interfere with MRI, decreased incidence of graft laceration (compared to metal), does not need removal, does not interfere with revision
        - **Cons** - screw failure during insertion, reaction to foreign body

    - 
- Screw
    - What is the difference between cortical and cancellous screw? Why?
        - Cancellous bone
            - Pull out rate is higher due to low density
            - So to reduce pull out risk, thread depth is bigger with larger pitch
        - Cortical screw
            - Concern is breakage of screw due to hard bone!
            - So Core is bigger to overcome that to increase screw rigidity
    - Why does fatigue failure occur at the neck shaft junction?
        - It is an area where there is a change in cross sectional area, and thus, it is an area of stress concentration.
    - Explain screw cut out in DHS?
        - Sliding mechanism in the screw has failed. The reason could be due to:
            - If short barrell is used ➔ shorter moment arm to resist varus torque
            - Screw trajectory mismatch resulting in cold welding/ sliding restriction
    - What is the working length of the screw?
        - Depends on whether the screw is unicortical or bicortical
        - If unicortical - it is the length within the CORTEX. Highly dependant on the cortical thickness
        - If bicortical - it is the length traversing through
        
        ![Untitled](../31%20Fracture%20Fixation%20Principles%205fcf8124524342ad966aa4a5c046093e/Untitled%209.png)
        
- Hip JRF
    - What happens if patient has AVN?
        - Assume collapse of femoral head ➔ reduced offset → leads to Glute insufficiency (requires force to stabilize pelvis due to shortened moment arm)
            - JRF increases significantly
    - if patient has L4/5 radiculopathy, which side should he hold his stick?
        - Weakness in glutes, So need to hold on opposite side to exert force in opposite direction
    - Draw Ankle JRF?
    - How do you explain why PFJ increases when patient goes up and down stairs?
    - Explain why the talus is shifted posteriorly during ankle fusion?
- TKR
    - What is the material of the TKR components?
        - Femur - Cobalt chrome
        - Tibia - Titanium (or cobalt chrome)
    - Because femur side is cobalt chrome and it is prepared with a coating for bone integration.
    - Titanium

    - What is the working length of a nail?
        - Depends on torsional or bending stresses
        - Torsional working length - is always between the 2 screws
            - Isthmus fit does not give resistance to torsion
        - Bending working length - unsupported portion of the nail
            - isthmus fit provides some resistance to bending too.
