- Case 1
    
    [Bone cement augmentation of femoral nail head elements increases their cut-out resistance in poor bone quality- A biomechanical study - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33582598/)
    
    - Calcar replacing cemented stem
    - Principles of arthroplasty in failure of IT fracture
        - Will not be using a primary stem but a revision stem with or without calcar replacement
        - Will need to have distal purchase or augmented purchase
        - Either a long cemented or long cementless stem
        - Will need long revision stems
- Case 2 - acetabular protrusio = RA
    - Definition of protrusio - femoral head exceed the ilioischial line
    - causes
        - Idiopathihc
        - Secondary - RA, rickets
    - Need to show that you know it is a difficult surgery - go chronologically
        - Altered anatomy. want to be careful of sciatic nerve. may be superficial in this case
    - How to manage the acetabular defect
        - Bone graft from head/ metal augments
        - revision cup with multiple holes - fire screws into ischium, pubic bone and ilium
        - “Antiprotrusio cage” with multiple screw holes
- Case 3 - AVN Hip
    - 80% bilateral!
    - Technique
        - Drill 8-10mm hole through subchondral necrosis KIV VF or Tantalum rods
    - options
        - Preserving
            - Core + adjuncts
                - wire to the collapse area
                - over drill e.g. with DHS reamer
                - insert graft
                - [risk of subtrochanteric fracture]
            - Osteotomies
            - Trapdoor
        - Replacement
    - ‼️ What is the rationale of core decompression?
        - To decompress intraosseous pressure
        - Increase blood flow
        - Promote healing response
    - Ceramic on ceramic XR - will not be able to see the holes on the cup
    
- Case 4 - periprosthetic #
    - Approach to fixing this B2 fractures
        - Adequate exposure
        - Use clamps to clamp down fragments
        - Then dislocate the hip to remove the implant
        - then fix the bone with cerclage
        - Then insert new implant and then tighten the cables
    - “Periprosthetic fixation plates”
        - Options for axis screws, monocortical locking screws
        - Options to attach to trochanter for proximal fixation
        - also options for cabling options
- Case 5 - Dysplastic hip
    - Types of femoral osteotomy?
        - GT sliding osteotomy
        - Subtrochanteric osteotomy
            - Step
            - Transverse
        - Considerations in Dysplastic hip
            - Hip center high or low
            - Restoring hip center - addressing lateral coverage
            - Need for a femoral osteotomy - types
            - Femur - valgus, anteverted and narrow - manage with small cemented stem
    - Does the femur get shorter?
        - Shorter but still longer then original
- Case 6 - AS
    - Considerations
        - Preop considerations - cervical spine issues, medications, osteoporosis, gluteus medius function
        - Intraop
            - Positioning
            - Excision of arthrodesis - insitu neck cut
            - Restoring primary arc range within functional range
        - Napkin ring osteotomy
        - [https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/61123](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/61123)
        - Stages of ankylosing? 3
        - Dagger sign - ossification of the supraspinous and interspinous ligament
            
            ![Untitled](../Ankylosing%20Spondylitis%20Spine%20and%20Hip%20DISH%20a1d44f8a7d554fac81481940351776bc/Untitled%203.png)
            
- Case 7 - THR instability
    - Will you counsel for open reduction?
        - No
        - if cannot open, then will do more imaging to plan for revision
    - CT pelvis with axial cut if femur with 3 cuts at knee to measure from the epicondylar axis as reference
    - How to see a dual mobility cup?
    - High ASA - weaker and frail - sarcopenia
    - Dual mobility is a “impingement device”
- Case 8 - Particle disease
    -
