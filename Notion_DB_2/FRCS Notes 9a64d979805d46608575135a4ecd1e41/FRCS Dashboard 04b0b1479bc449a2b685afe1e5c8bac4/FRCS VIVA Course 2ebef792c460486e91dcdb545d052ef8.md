### Basic Science by Francis Wong

- PPV and NPV

    - Add more variables and the accuracy improves
- Screening test = high specificity

- RCT - 5 components
    - Blinding and Randomization
        - Randomization
            - **Simple** randomization. (head vs tails) But issue is due to chance, may not be same number in he group
            - **Group** Randomization
                - E.g. 5 groups of 20, then computer randomize
                - Advantage on top of simple randomization
                - Numbers can be controlled
                - Can start analysis even when you haven’t finish the number or when unable to recruit number of patients.
        - Blinding
            - Single vs double vs triple (assessor). But in orthopaedics, hard to blind the surgeon. You can blind the assessor and the patient.

    - What surgical options before PRC or 4CF?
        - Wrist denervation can be done
    - Between 4CF and PRC what are the expected ROM and grip strength?
        - PRC - expect poorer weak strength due to shortening of tendons (theoretical)
        - But overall minimal difference - expect ROM 60%, grip strength 80%
    - What other fusions you aware of?
        - Limited intercarpal fusions
        - e.g. Lunate capitate fusion - after excision of scaphoid and KIV triquetrium.

        - More than 90% of patients in this series achieved a safe brake-reaction time within 6 weeks of TAA, and those who did not were more likely to have had more pain and a stiffer ankle. Surgeons might counsel patients with persistent pain and stiffness at 6 weeks to delay driving for an additional 3 weeks, since by 9 weeks after TAA, all patients in this series had a brake-reaction time comparable with patients who had not undergone surgery.

    - Corner fracture
- [BS - PHYSIS]
- [BS - screening]
    - disease - natural history, critical time point, treatment available and acceptable
    - screening test - specific and sensitive. good screening test is specific (spin). easy, cheap
- [BS - tourniquet]
    - Limb occlusion pressure variables - width of cuff, circumference of limb.
- [BS - muscle relaxation]
    - How does ligamentotaxis work?
        - When ligaments are relaxed, they have crimp
        - After stretching them, till the elastic zone, they can then aid in reduction as a tension band
    - Do muscles relax when you apply traction?
        - No, initially they respond with contraction
        - Monosynaptic reflex, meaning it goes to the spinal cord at the same level and return to cause contraction of the muscle
    - How does traction before reduction work?
        - When one pulls the muscle, it contracts due to stretch reflex
        - However, this traction persistently stimulates the Golgi tendon organs in the muscles
        - This leads to the golgi tendon stretch reflex aka inverse stretch reflex occurs, causing relaxation
    - lignocaine
        - Physical reversible inhibitor of the sodium voltage gated channels
- [BS - POP]
    - Mesh is cotton
    - “Exothermic reaction - “latent heat crystallisation”
    - what influence?
    - Hip spica cast - highest rate of heat injury
        - low ventilation
    - Why not resin cast?
        - Resin cast is more expensive
        - Resin cast is stronger and thus less give, thus unable to accomodate swelling
    - What is a resin cast?

    - to check PL and post tib - you should flex the knee, one hand palpating the PL tendon, one hand resisting the foot in inversion and plantar flexion.
    - SIlverferskoid test to look at the lateral side
    - How do you identify the subtalar joint?
        - Medial mal, lateral mal; just in front is the talar neck;
        - Hold the talar neck, cup the heel and do inversion eversion
    - How do you assess the Transverse tarsal joint?
        - Fix the calcaneum - by doing so you obliterate the proximal joints (subtalar and tibio talar) ➔ do inversion eversion
