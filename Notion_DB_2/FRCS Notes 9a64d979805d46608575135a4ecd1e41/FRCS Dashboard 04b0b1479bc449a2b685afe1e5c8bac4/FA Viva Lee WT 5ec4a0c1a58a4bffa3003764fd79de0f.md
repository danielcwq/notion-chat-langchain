# FA Viva Lee WT

- Patient is a smoker → risk of non union infection
- patient has no lift landing → may need step down care
- Short cases
    - prepare equipment
- Case 1 - foot drop
    - Foot drop gait.
    - “normal cadence, no listing, SYMMETRICAL arm swing.”
    - “lack of ankle dorsiflexion, high steppage and landing flat on the ground”
    - “I will like to proceed to do History, PE and invx”
    - History - main intent is to look for level. functional deficit
    - PE - cause
        - Full neuro exam including spine
        - Examination of foot - to look for power of the tendons around the foot
        - Full vascular exam
    - Invx -
    - Cause - neuro vs non neuro
    - Tendon transfer principles
    - 3 strategies
        - EHL to tib ant transfer with fusion of IPJ to prevent toe stubbing * done more in adults
            - Put to middle or lateral cuneiform to prevent supination
            - If CPN is affected ➔ use post tib
        - Static restraint method -
        - Fusion of joint
    - Tendon transfer principles? Donor, Joint and bed factors.
- Case 2 - Pes planus
    - Assessment for
        - Underlying Etiology -
        - Rigid vs Flexible
        - Complication of this disease
        - Management options
    - ** Arches of the foot?
    - XR - look for coalitions. ask for ANKLE XR
    - Goal of treatment - painless plantigrade foot
        - Dependant on symptoms and function
        - **Non op vs op**
        - Op
            - Flexible - tendon transfers and osteotomies
            - Rigid - fusion
    - What I am looking out for in the history?
        - Underlying etiology/ Risk factors
        - Severity - functional deficit, sepsis
        - Factors that will affect my management
        - Specific
            - Flat foot - fixed or rigid
- Case 3 - Charcot Foot
    - Assessment for
    - Management goal: achieve a painless plantigrade foot at end of coalescence stage with the option of deformity correction when in the consolidation stage
- Case 4 - lateral ligament complex torn
    - demonstration of torn CFL
    - In my history and physical examination
        - Underlying etiology - trauma/ recurrence
        - Complication - pain with OCL
        - Risk factors - pes Cavus, hyperlaxity
        - Management
- Case 5 - Hallux valgus
    - THings that can affect treatment
        - Function and symptoms
        - Associated problems - TMTJ hypermobility, OA
    - Surgical treatment for hallux valgus?
        - Fusion vs Correction dependant on severity and associated conditions
            - Fusion is indicated if severe/ TMTJ hyperlaxity/ underlying OA
            - Correction is a combination of bony and soft tissue procedures
    - Use IMA to guide treatments
- Case 6 - Pes Cavus
    - I will approach this patient with a triple assessment of Hx PE and Invx
    - In my hx and Pe, i am looking for
        - Etiology
        - severity
        - Specific - flexible or dynamic
        - complications
        - factors that will affect my management
    - Management goal is -
    - Management plan is non op vs op depending on flexibility of the foot
    - Weil’s + fusion
