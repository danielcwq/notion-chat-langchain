    - This is a **Complex Primary**
    - **Pre-op - 5 things to be concerned**
        - 1. Disease and its complications related control
            - Check disease control - ALP, LDH, Serum tartrate resistant phosphatase levels, Urine test
            - Aim to do in Burn out phase (lytic/ active phase will have bleeding ++ and risk of loosening)
            - Endocrine review for **Hypercalcemia**
            - Cardio review - **High cardiac output** failure
        - 2. Deformity correction and implications
            - Templating - for deformity planning for **osteotomies** (rarely needed)
            - Standby large prosthesis inventory (protrusio, require large cup), stemmed implants
        - 3. Fixation choice - cement vs cementless
            - Implant choice - aware of concerns with cement interdigitation, some reccomend cementless. However, systematic reviews found no difference but there was a paucity of data. I will use a hybrid fixation which I am familiar with.
            - If for deformity correction with osteotomy ‚ûî cementless stems
        - 4. Equipment requirement
            - Stand by equipment - sharp burrs to cut sclerotic bone
            - II for deformity correction and fixation
        - 5. Blood loss management
            - Blood loss - Cross match, cell saver, autologous blood donation, TXA
        - 6. ?Need TRO secondary osteosarcoma - biopsy
    - Intraop
        - Approach - extensile to manage complications, soft tissue contractures may need releases
        - Femoral prep - Rasps may be difficult to use in sclerotic bone. Use high speed burr. (need sharp equipment)
        - Reduce blood loss - Meticulous hemostasis during approach, hypotensive anaesthesia, [TKR] Tourniquet to reduce blood loss
        - Address deformities
            - **Bowing** - osteotomies with long stem implants bypassing by 2 cortical diameters
                
                ![Untitled](Benign%20Tumor-Like%20Lesions%204af732e1c13d46d8bf4a4b769b129084/Untitled%2016.png)
                
    - Post op
        - Risk of HO up to 50%
        - **HO** prophylaxis - Indomethacin 75mg OM x 6/52 OR Radiotherapy pre op 7gray 72 hours before op

    ![Untitled](Benign%20Tumor-Like%20Lesions%204af732e1c13d46d8bf4a4b769b129084/Untitled%2020.png)
    
    - Complex primary
    - Pre Op
        1. **Implant** choice - cemented in view of osteointegration concerns, hypervascularity makes it difficult for canal prep, may need small DDH stems with hybrid cementless cup
        2. Address **deformities** - Templating - patient may have coxa vara deformities
        3. **Equipment** stand by
            1. Instrumentation - use of high speed burrs and sharp drills, stand by few sets as they get blunt easily
            - Stand by fracture fixation equipment - femur plates, cerclage wires
            - Stand by Fluoroscopy for fracture management
            - Stand by long operative time - long list, inform anaesthesia, stand by for blood loss and unpredictability
        4. **Blood** management due to anemia - cell saver, hemostasis
    - Intraop
        - Plan for extensile posterior approach KIV ETO to help create bony cavity for stem has been reported
        - Instrumentation - use of high speed burrs and drills instead of broaching to avoid fractures
        - Irrigation while drilling - to avoid heat
        - Mentally prepared for fractures, especially during final implant impaction - need to be gentle.
            - Acetabular side - usually posterior wall. Usually can be managed with supplemental screw fixation
            - Femur side - fracture at tip - may require fixation with plate and cerclage wires/ screws
    - Post Op
        - Scrutinize post op XR - KIV NWB if any suspected fracture

    - hong2015.pdf
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Heterotopic Ossification Prophylaxis?
    - **Indomethacin** 75mg OM for 6/52 post op
        - Current studies show that selective Cox 2 inhibitors e.g. etorocoxibs are as just as effective [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081155/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081155/)
        - Some surgeons just use arcoxia as part of their early pain relief
    - **Radiotherapy**: single periop dose of 700cGy = 700 rad
        - 4 hours pre op
        - or within 72 hours post op
- Management of Heterotopic Ossification?
    - Evaluate for **maturity** (12- 18 months) by:
        - Serial **XR**
        - **ALP** (ALP is raised in osteoblastic activity)
        - Or **Bone scan** - some authors suggest doing bone scan at onset of HO for baseline and then looking at decreasing trend in blood flow and blood pool activity followed by steady state for two to three months as an indication of disease maturity at which time surgery can be done to improve joint mobility
            - [https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/50/supplement_2/1050](https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/50/supplement_2/1050)
