- ‼️ What classification will you use for cartilage injuries?
    - **ICRS** - International Cartilage Repair Society Classification System = ONLY deals with depth
        - 0 = normal
        - 1 = softening [same as outerbridge]
        - 2 = < 50%
        - 3 = > 50%
        - 4 = through subchondral bone
            
            ![Untitled](Cartilage%20Injuries%20OCD%20%5BKnee,%20Talus%5D%20068234726e4d4728ae38fe7ccfdca636/Untitled.png)
            
    - **Outerbridge** = Has a **diameter** component[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6259817/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6259817/)
        - 0 = normal
        - 1 = chondral softening + swelling (intraop tactile feedback with probe)
        - 2 = Partial thickness, **< 0.5 inches**, does not reach subchondral bone
        - 3 = **> 0.5 inches** in dameter, or reach subchondral bone
        - 4 = Subchondral bone exposed

- What available procedures?
    - Debridement of flaps
    - Microfractures (< 2cm)
        - Creation of subchondral perforations to allow hearing with fibrocartilage
        - Mainly type 1 fibrocartilage is formed
    - Osteochondral **Autograft** transplantation (OAT) aka Mosaicplasty (Small lesions 2cm2)
        - Autograft taken from non weight bearing site of knee e.g. superior trochlear ridge and intercondylar notch
            
            ![Untitled](Cartilage%20Injuries%20OCD%20%5BKnee,%20Talus%5D%20068234726e4d4728ae38fe7ccfdca636/Untitled%202.png)
            
        - Cylindrical plug, 8mm long and 4-12mm diameter
    - MEGA-OATS = large osteochondral autogenous transplant system (up to 35mm diameter/ 96mm2)
        - From posterior femoral condyle ➔ usually remodels
        - Involved in flexion 30-60 °
            
            ![Untitled](Cartilage%20Injuries%20OCD%20%5BKnee,%20Talus%5D%20068234726e4d4728ae38fe7ccfdca636/Untitled%203.png)
            
            ![Post harvest](Cartilage%20Injuries%20OCD%20%5BKnee,%20Talus%5D%20068234726e4d4728ae38fe7ccfdca636/Untitled%204.png)
            
            Post harvest
            
            ![Remodelling present](Cartilage%20Injuries%20OCD%20%5BKnee,%20Talus%5D%20068234726e4d4728ae38fe7ccfdca636/Untitled%205.png)
            
            Remodelling present
            
    - Osteochondral **Allograft** Transplantation (OCA)
    - Autologous Chondrocyte implantation (ACI)
        - 2 stage procedure:
        - Arthroscopic harvesting and growth of chondrocytes in lab for 55/52
        - Open implantation
- What complications of microfracture?
    - intralesional osteophytes
- What are the downsides of Osteochondral **Allograft** Transplantation?
    - High costs - screening and prep
    - **Time sensitive** - chondrocyte viability decreases after 2/52, death within 1/12. Reccomended implantation within 1 month; inclusive of 2 weeks of bacterial screening - so only 2 week window!

## OCD Knee

- Most common location? Bilateral rates?
    - 75% in the posterolateral aspect of MEDIAL femoral condyle, Harding’s Area
    - Medial : Lateral 80:20
    - Bilateral 20%
- Pathogenesis?
    - Poorly understood
    - Trauma - single or multi trauma
    - Local ischemia with subchondral AVN
- Hx?
    - Recurrent effusions, stiffness, pain
- Classic PE sign in the knee in OCD?
    - **Wilson's sign** = induction of pain as the knee is **passively extended** with tibia is held in **internal rotation.**
        - This is because tibial spine contacts the OCD on the lateral aspect of the MFC at 30 ° flexion
    - Painful and **relieved when repeated in ER = +ve**
- Special XR view? Classic location on XR?
    - **Tunnel view** - knee bent to 45 °, XR beam perpendicular to tibia axis

    - Lesion is classically contained in the Harding Area = triangle bounded by **Blaumensaat line** and the **Posterior femoral cortex**
        - Location is usually in the middle area as defined by harding.
        - on AP, Cahill classify based on the 5 zones from medial to lateral

- Classifications of OCD Knee?
    - Pappas Classifx = By age at detection
        - 1 = Below **12** (excellent prognosis)
        - 2 = 12-20 yo
        - 3 = **>20** yo
    - **DiPaola** **MRI** Classification (1991)
        - 1 = thickened but no break
        - 2 = low signal rim behind fragment = incomplete
        - 3 = high signal T2 behind fragment = fluid = detached but not displaced
        - 4 = loose body = displaced

    - Clanton and Delee Classification for knee (**CT** scan)
        - 1 = Depressed OCD fracture
        - 2 = Attached by osseous bridge = incomplete
        - 3 = Detached but not displaced
        - 4 = Displaced
    - Ghul (1982) = **Arthroscopic** Assessment

- What are the possible clinical scenarios and management of Knee OCD (also for Elbow OCD and Talus OCD)?
    - Based on JAAOS CPG 2010 for the knee - 4 main scenarios:
        - **Asymptomatic** OCD = inconclusive evidence ➔ observation
        - **Symptomatic**, STABLE OCD “Even though CPG unable to make recommendations, I will give a trial of non operative treatment and if it fails to consider trans-articular drilling”
            - **Transarticular vs retroarticular drilling**? Gunton et al. CORR 2013 systematic review - comparable radiographic healing rates and functional outcomes

        - **Symptomatic**, **UNSTABLE** OCD, CPG consensus is to offer fixation
            - Debride fibrous tissue at base of lesion
            - Bone graft if presence of bone void
            - Fix with bioabsorbable devices/ Herbert screws
        - **Unsalvageable**
            - Treat as per cartilage defect
            - Can excise and fill defect with scafolds
    - CPG for Knee
        
        [OCS CPG 2010.pdf](Cartilage%20Injuries%20OCD%20%5BKnee,%20Talus%5D%20068234726e4d4728ae38fe7ccfdca636/OCS_CPG_2010.pdf)
        
        - Point 4 - asymptomatic knee
        - Point 5/6 - symptomatic, stable knee for driling
        - Point 7 - symptomatic, unstable ➔ repair
