- ‼️ What is Dupuytren's? What Collagen and histology?
    - Proliferation of **myofibroblasts** with laying down of **collagen 3** and contractile proteins leading to formation of cords and nodules
    - Pathogenesis as proposed by Al-Qattan - genetic predisposition triggered by ischemic effects of smoking/ DM/ trauma/ aging/ Alcohol ➔ increases free radicals ➔ increases fibroblast proliferation

- Risk factors?
    - Males (japanese, caucasians, scandinavians), Diabetes, Liver Disease, Smoking, AIDS
- ‼️ Classification  and ⚠️ Stages of Duputryen's?
    - Tubiana Staging based on the **composite** contractures of PIPJ and MCPJ

    - **Luck** stages - PIR
        - Proliferative ➔ involutional ➔ residual
- ⚠️ What is Dupuytren's Diasthesis? Implications?

    - **BERRYS** - bilateral, Ectopic, Radial side, Recurrence, Young, Sex - male
    - Young onset < 40, bilateral, **Ledderhose** disease (plantar fascia), **Peyronie’s** disease (Dartos fascia of penis), **Garrod** Disease (knuckle pads over PIPJ dorsum)
    - **Implications** - higher recurrence rates, likely skin involvement, may need dermatofasiectomy, conservative unlikely to work
- ‼️ Ligaments of the Finger and the pathological change?
    - Pathoanatomy is not well understood and no clear consensus
    - According to JAAOS review in 2013, there are 6 Cords in Duputryens
    - 1. [MCPJ Contracture] Pretenditnous band ➔ **Pretendinous** cord
    - 2. [PIPJ contracture] Extension of  pretentinous band in palm ➔ **Central cord**
    - 3. [PIPJ contracture + NVB centralization]  Spiral band + Lateral Digital sheet + Grayson ➔ **Spiral Cord**
    - 4. [PIPJ and DIPJ contracture] Lateral Digital Sheet ➔ **lateral cord**
        - (VOC) cannot differentiate spiral and lateral cord clinically. Only intraop. But cord in the lateral part of the finger is spiral unless proven otherwise due to the risk of vascular compromise.
    - 5. [DIPJ contracture]Digital Fascia dorsal to neurovascular bundle ➔ **Retrovascular cord**
    - 6. [Webspace contracture] Natatory Ligaments ➔ **Natatory** Cord
    - Commissural cord - between thumb and index

- Which ligament is classically said to be not involved?
    - **Cleland's** ligaments AND transverse ligament of palmar aponeurosis
    - However, recent histological studies in JHS (europe) found that histologically they are affected
        
        ![Cleland is on the dorsum (ceiling)](Dupuytren%E2%80%99s%20Disease%205a20a470ba7d45418d905a975c501327/Untitled%205.png)

- ⚠️ Indications for surgery?
    - Hueston table top test +ve = unable to place **palm** flat on table
    - MCPJ contracture **> 30**
    - PIPJ contracture **> 15** (PIPJ more disabling and less correctable) (some authors even says any degree of PIPJ contracture)

- What is the management options?
    - Non Op
        - PT
        - Collagenase Injection (hyaflex) - Inject and return next day for manipulation
        - Cx –  hematoma, blistering
        - Needle Aponeurotomy
            - Can be done in clinic, light sedation
            - Use needles to "perforate, slice and clear" contractures
            - Risk of infection, NV injury, skin breaks
    - Op
        - Fasciotomy = cut fascia
            - Only for well defined cords
            - Can be done under LA with needle
            - Risk of NVB injury
        - Limited Partial fasciectomy = excise fascia
        - Dermatofasciectomy = excise fascia + skin + full thickness hair free skin graft for "firebreak"
        - McCash Open Palm technique
        - Amputation

- ‼️ What is the protocol for collagenase injection? Complications?
    - Inject and return next day for manipulation
    - 2-3-4-5 (2 fingers, 3 injections, 4 week intervals, dose is 0.**5**8mg)
    - The patient can receive **up to a maximum of three injections** per cord, limited to **two digits** (one at a time) at **4-week intervals.**
    - Dose is **0.58mg**  based on the UK CORDLESS trial
    - The complications of this treatment include swollen lymph nodes, itching, pain, swelling, injection site bleeding, tenderness and bruising.
- How will you consent for surgery?
    - I will consent by explaining to her the
        - “Indications, alternatives and Risks”
    - indications - loss of function…
    - Alternatives - therapy, will not reverse
    - Risks, other than anaesthetic risks
        - Specific
            - Early
                - Injury to NVB
                - Correction not 100%
                - Cosmesis may be poor
                - Risk of infection/ delay wound healing/ need for skin grafts
            - Late
                - Recurrence 30-50% at 10 years; **Diasthesis - almost 100%**
- **What incision? Draw!**
    - “Longitudinal Z-plasty incision” will allow me to achieve more length
        
        ![Untitled](Dupuytren%E2%80%99s%20Disease%205a20a470ba7d45418d905a975c501327/Untitled%208.png)
        
- Most important complication to be aware of?
    - BEWARE NVB that is more midline now due to **spiral cord** pushing it more central
        
        ![Untitled](Dupuytren%E2%80%99s%20Disease%205a20a470ba7d45418d905a975c501327/Untitled%209.png)
        
    - I will also start my dissection in the palm where the NVB is more easily identifiable
    - Check **digital allen test** before op
- How do you protect the NVB?
    - Trace NVB proximally and distally towards the contracture

- Is dermatofasiectomy better?
    - Controversial
        - Previous **Armstrong study** JBJS 2000 if 143 fingers retrospective case series. Found recurrence rates to be 8% as compared to fasciectomy which can be as high as 27-66%
        
        [Armstrong et al..pdf](Dupuytren%E2%80%99s%20Disease%205a20a470ba7d45418d905a975c501327/Armstrong_et_al..pdf)
        
    - However, recent study by [Ullah et al. 2009 in JBJS - RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19258615/) of 79 patients fasciectomy vs dermatofasciectomy.
        - No difference in recurrence rates **(12.2%),** no difference in correction up to 3 years after surgery

- Clostridium Histolyticium injection vs surgery?
    - Aware of a [CORDLESS trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26096221/) published in 2015. ‘Collagenase option for Reduction of Dupuytren Longer Term Evaluation of Safety Study]
    - Study of more than 1000 joints, found that the
        - **60% (623 out of 1081)Successfully treated** defined as < 5 ° contracture
        - 30% (302 out of 1081) measurably improved defined as reduction of > 20 ° but not to success definition
        - 10% not effectively treated
        - Recurrence defined as 20 ° or greater worsening relative to day 30 after last injection
        - Recurrence rate was **47%** at 5 years, comparable with recurrence rates after surgical treatment.
        - Surgical treatment recurrence -  **has been reported to be as high as 66%, but with dermatofasciectomy as by Armstrong in JBJS 10% recurrence at 5 years)**
    - Certain patient group - MCPJ contractures < 20 °

- Why is PIPJ contracture more difficult to correct?
    - The presence of **check-rein ligaments** at the volar plate of the palmar plate further worsens the contracture ➔ needs to be released other than the central cord

- Have you heard of the open palm Maccash technique?
    - Yes. Transverse incisions in skin creases
    - Division of fascial bands
    - Splint fingers in extension for 4 weeks after operation
    - Wounds left open and allowed to heal by granulation.
