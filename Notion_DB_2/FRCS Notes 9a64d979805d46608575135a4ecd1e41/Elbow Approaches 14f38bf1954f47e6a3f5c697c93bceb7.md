## Lateral Approaches

![Untitled](Elbow%20Approaches%2014f38bf1954f47e6a3f5c697c93bceb7/Untitled.png)

### Kocher's Approach

- Plane = ECU (PIN) // Anconeus (Radial). (Sequences of extensor muscle is Anconeus-ECU-EDC-ECRB)
- Danger = PIN, LUCL
- I – lateral epicondyle to 6cm from tip of olecranon
- D: Skin ➔ Subcut ➔ Go between ECU// Anconeus ➔ **Pronate** arm fully to bring PIN away

### EDC Splitting

- Same as kocher. but go thru EDC bulk

### Kaplan Approach ➔ Goes into Thompson approach

- Plane = EDC // ECRB
- More anterior than Kocher
- Lower risk of injuring LUCL, but higher risk of PIN injury! (Gavin does not recommend)
- Deep - Elevate the supinator with forearm in **supination** to bring the PIN out of the field and the insertion of supinator into view

## Medial Approaches

![Untitled](Elbow%20Approaches%2014f38bf1954f47e6a3f5c697c93bceb7/Untitled%202.png)

### 1. **Hotchkiss** over the Top [OVER the FCU]

- [Most anterior ➔ Can see Coronoid best]
- **Plane**: Between FCU and PL, **elevating anterior half of pronator mass (PL, PT, FCR)**
- Danger: Ulnar nerve
- I: From Medial epicondyle longitudinal along medial forearm
- D: Skin, Subcut ➔ identify + protect Ulnar nerve! ➔ Identify plane ➔ Elevate Anterior flexor pronator mass

### 2. FCU splitting approach

- Plane = Between Humeral and ulnar heads of FCU, Elevating anterior half of FCU, PL, PT, FCR

### 3. Taylor and Sham Approach [BELOW FCU; Elevate entire flexor mass]

- Plane = Elevation of entire Flexor mass from ulnar

### Medial epicondylectomy (max exposure)

---

## Anterior Approaches

### Anterolateral Approach to Elbow [Proximal extension from Henry’s Approach]

- Plane = proximally **BR // Brachialis** lateral part (so no internervous plane as both are radial nerve), distally BR // PT
- Supine Hand table tourniquet
- **I** - Lazy S incision with lateral proximal along biceps and Medial along medial to BR (opposite from Anterior approach to elbow to cubital fossa)

- **S** - identify and protect LABCN ➔incise medial to BR ➔ retract brachialis and pronater teres, biceps tendon medially to reveal the supinator ➔ ligate recurrent vessels from radial artery
- **D** - Incise the supinator with arm in full supination

### Anterior Approach (to cubital fossa for brachial artery exploration)

- Plane is between PT and BR
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-03 at 6.59.17 AM.png](Elbow%20Approaches%2014f38bf1954f47e6a3f5c697c93bceb7/Screenshot_2022-06-03_at_6.59.17_AM.png)
    
- P - Supine, arm on board
- I - Lazy S incision with **medial proximally** (allow tracing of structures proximally which are medial to the biceps tendon), lateral distally medial to Brachioradialis
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-03 at 6.49.00 AM.png](Elbow%20Approaches%2014f38bf1954f47e6a3f5c697c93bceb7/Screenshot_2022-06-03_at_6.49.00_AM.png)
    
- S - **identify and protect LABCN** between biceps and brachialis ➔ incise bicipital aponeurosis (lacertus fibrosus) at its origin at the biceps tendon
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-06-03 at 6.49.16 AM.png](Elbow%20Approaches%2014f38bf1954f47e6a3f5c697c93bceb7/Screenshot_2022-06-03_at_6.49.16_AM.png)
    
- D - should see the radial artery medial to the biceps tendon (**TAN**)

## Others

- Elbow Arthroscopy
    - Pre op check - ULNAR NERVE TRANSPOSITION?
    - Positioning
        - Supine with arm holder across body
        - OR Lateral Decubitus position (like fixing olecranon)
    - Many portals described - Most common
        
        ![Untitled](Elbow%20Approaches%2014f38bf1954f47e6a3f5c697c93bceb7/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - PAMP (proximal anteromedial portal)
            - FIRST to establish
            - 2cm proximal from ME, anterior to intermuscular septum
            - Dissect above septum
            - Insert trocha directly contact with anterior humerus (prevent MEDIAN nerve injury)
        - PALP (proximal anterolateral portal)
            - 2cm proximal from LE, 1cm anterior to LE
            - Spinal needle while viewing with PAMP portal
            - Again point towards humerus when penetrating joint capsule to prevent RADIAL nerve injury
        - Direct posterior portal
            - 3cm from tip of olecranon, directly pierce through triceps
