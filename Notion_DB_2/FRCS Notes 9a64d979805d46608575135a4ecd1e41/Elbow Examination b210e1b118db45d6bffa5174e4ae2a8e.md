Date Created: June 10, 2022 4:45 PM
Final Review: August 31, 2022
Property: July 14, 2022
Status: Not started
Studies: Revised x 1
Topic: Physical Exam

## Elbow General

- **[STAND AND LOOK]**
    - Ask patient to spread elbows out extended
    - Look at carrying angle - (9-11 ° )
    - Look for lumps - popeye, reverse popeye, scars
    - **Lift arms straight up** - look at elbow for scars, Hypopigmentations at sites of injection
    - Then ask to bring down to 90 degrees. Check ROM
        - Flex and extend - watch also for popeye
        - At terminal end range - check for flexion or extension impingement signs
    - Bring elbow to side ➔
        - check Pronation supination - use thumbs to as marker with arms tucked in
- **[PALPATION]**
    - Hand moves into with 3 fingers - thumb and middle finger on the epicondyles, index finger on the olecranon
        - “2 epicondyles and olecranon forms an isoceles triangle”
        - **Medially** - “ulnar nerve not thickened, does not subluxate with flexion/ extension”
        - **Lateral** - radial head rotating well
    - Evaluating for biceps tendon
- **[POWER]** - Watch for Popeye
    - Flexion strength
    - Supination strength
    - Pronation strength
    - Extension strength
- **[SPECIAL TESTS]**
    - **Hook** test- hook from lateral to medial
        - Flex and supinate elbow with resistance
        - MUST be able to go under it if not it is the lacertus fibrosus
    - 3 features each of golfer's elbow and tennis elbow
        - local tenderness
        - Compare grips - Poor grip
        - Provacative with Cozen test for TE
    - **Instability** tests
        - Do the standard VV tests first
            - **MCL -** fully ER the shoulder to lock it, Flexed slightly to remove olecranon out of the olecranon notch and do a valgus stress
            - **LCL -** fully IR the shoulder to lock it, flex to get olecranon out of notch
        - **Other tests to offer if prompted:**
            - **Pivot shift test** - forearm supinated with valgus stress and axial compression
                
                ![Untitled](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/Untitled.png)
                
                - Also can do the chair rise or push up test with forearm supinated and axial loaded
                
                ![Untitled](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/Untitled%201.png)
                
            - Medial - Milkman test
    - Screen MUR nerves with power and sensation
- [Complete]
    - Check **function** 3 moves
    - Check radial pulse
    - MUR nerves

## Scenarios

### OA Elbow

- Restrict AROM and PROM in Flexion and extension
- ALWAYS **CHECK ULNAR NERVE**

### Radioulnar synostosis

- Look
    - Already on inspection, unable to supinate to demonstrate carrying angle
        
        ![IMG_0082.PNG](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/IMG_0082.png)
        
    - Flexion/ extension ok
    - Very restricted Pronosupination
        
        ![IMG_0083.PNG](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/IMG_0083.png)
        
- Differentiate if restriction is at the radiocarpal joint by holding the forearm
    
    ![IMG_0084.PNG](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/IMG_0084.png)
    
- Check function - hand to mouth and hand to back side.
- Complete my exam by asking a few questions - any family history (sporadic but usually AD), previous trauma
- Look at XR to classify based on clearly and **omar** classification

### Distal biceps rupture ➔ **VERY HARD TO SEE

![IMG_0079.PNG](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/IMG_0079.png)

- Check flexion and supination **strength** (expect supination to be affected more)
- Supination is being compensated by common extensor mechanism ➔ risk of tennis elbow

### Cubitus Varus Deformity (may actually be bilateral subluxed radial head)

![Untitled](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/Untitled%202.png)

- Inspection
    - Mention cubitus varus - can be :
        - Supracondylar Fracture
        - Distal Humeral Physeal Separation (70% get varus!)
        - OR lateral condyle with overgrowth
        - OR exostosis
    - Mention scars - laterally or medially or anterior (to suggest exploration of brachial artery)
    - Screening of MUR nerves
        - extra step to check index finger DIPJ flexion
        - “no AIN palsy that is associated with extension type supracon # nor ulnar nerve palsy associated with flexion type”
- Move - mention ROM deficit
    
    ![Untitled](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - likely limited in flexion due to supra con usually being extension injury
    - P/S should be normal
- Palpation - for any tenderness
- Special test
    - “Assess for Posterolateral instability” with pivot shift test
- Check Radial pulse - no deficit

### Cubitus Valgus Deformity

- Inspection
    - Possible causes:
        - Can be lat con # with growth arrest
        - Rarely supracondylar # with overgrowth (3%)
    - Mention cubitus valgus
    - Mention scars - laterally or medially or anteriorly
    - Check ROM
    - Check MUR nerves screen

### Painless radial head dislocation

![Untitled](Elbow%20Examination%20b210e1b118db45d6bffa5174e4ae2a8e/Untitled%204.png)

- "A painless bony lump in posteroateral aspect of elbow is invariably a painless dislocated radial head"

- 5 Possible causes of painless radial head dislocation?
    - Nail patella syndrome!
    - Achondroplasia
    - Congenital Radioulnar synostosis  - cleary and omar type 3 with posterior dislocation!
    - Forearm Exostoses (masada type 2)
    - Chronic monteggia

### Tennis elbow

- Tinel tro radial tunnel syndrome

### Golfers elbow

- Tinel tro ulnar nerve syndrome

Can come in as a segway into - MHE (short forearm, with lumps)

## Questions

- What is the elbow functional range?
    - Functional range is 30-130, functional P/S = 50 ° on either side
