### Anterior Shoulder Instability

- What are the stabilizers of the Shoulder?
    - [22. Shoulder and Elbow Biomech](22%20Shoulder%20and%20Elbow%20Biomech%200f33cdc5099346d8a68018d8e7227503.md)
- Initial assessment of dislocation?
    - Arm position at acute setting is Abducted in ER (Posterior is Adducted and IR)
- ‼️ How will you acutely reduce?
    - **Kocher** – Elbow flexion, Traction and ER ➔ shoulder adduction ➔ IR arm

- Other methods include
    - Elderly can consider the FARES method - which is using gentle diversionary anterior-posterior oscillations, abduction with gentle traction with external rotation
        - Supine, apply traction, contin
    - traction-counter traction method
- How can you classify this shoulder instability?
    - Dependant on the etiology via the Stanmore Classifiation
    - Type 1 - traumatic (thomas matsen TUBS)
    - Type 2 - Multidirectional (Thomas Matsen AMBRII)
    - Type 3 - muscle patterning
- Any special XR view to look at the associated lesions?
    - Stryker Notch view to look at hill sach

- What you looking for in MRI?
    - Bankart - bony or soft tissue ➔ if bony look at en face view
    - Associated injuries - RC tear, hill sach lesion, HAGL lesion (humeral avulsion of glenohumeral ligament)
- ‼️ Variants in Labral injury?
    - **Bankart** = Torn labrum and periosteum - most common. 90% of all dislocations
    - **Perthes** = Torn labrum but INTACT periosteum which reduces it to normal location i.e. **undisplaced** ➔ partial healing
    - **ALPSA** = Anterior labroligamentous periosteal sleeve avulsion = Labrum torn with INTACT periosteum but **displaced** and medialized
    - **GLAD** = glenoid labrum articular disruption i.e. articular surface affected
    - **HAGL** = Humeral avulsion of IGHL 9%

        ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%203.png)
        
- What are some Normal labral variants?
    - Buford Complex
        - **Cordlike** MHGL with **absent Anterosuperior** labrum
        - Isolated Buford - does not need surgery. If repaired ➔ leads to restricted shoulder rotation and elevation
            
            ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%204.png)
            
    - Sublabral Foramen
        - Localised **detachment of labrum from glenoid rim at the 2 Oclock positio**n, anterior to biceps anchor.
            
            ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%205.png)
            
- ‼️ Will you offer surgery for a first time dislocator?
    - No. I will offer conservative management and will only consider if recurrent
    - This is based on [Hovelius et al. JBJS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18451384/) 2008 prospective study of 255 patients who are from 12-40 years old.
    - After **25 years**, more than 50% of those under 25 did not experience recurrent dislocation
    
    [Nonoperative treatment of primary anterior shoulder dislocation in patients forty years of age and younger. a prospective twenty-five-year follow-up - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18451384/)
    
- Prognostic factors of recurrence?
    - **Age** at first dislocation is best prognostication
    - Initial landmark studies from WestPoint military Academy found that 92% of cadets under 25 had recurrent dislocations
    - <20 yo 80%, 20-40yo 60%, > 40 yo 10%
- ‼️ How do you decide if need laterjet?
    - ISIS score (instability Severity Index Score)
        - Balg and Boileau JBJS 2007
        - 6 components clinical and radiological of max 10 points.
            
            ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%206.png)
            
        - 6 and below = repair. (**< 10% recurrence**)
        - > 6 laterjet (**70% recurrence risk**)
    - Critical Defect > 25%
        - Burkhart 2007 **67% recurrence rate for 25% bony bankart** (regardless Hill sach), 4.9% if < 25%
- How do you decide if need Remplissage procedure?
    - Depends on the Hill Sach lesion – Is it engaging? 2 ways to assess - pre op and intraop
    - Pre op imaging – **Glenoid tracking by Itoi, Bukhart 2014**
        - If HSL stays within glenoid track (on-track) = no engagement
        - If HSL goes out of glenoid track (off track) = engaging lesion
    - Dynamic examination during surgery AFTER bankart repair (but risk of damaging repair)
    - “Bipolar lesion”
- What is Laterjet procedure?
    - Principles (4) – increase surface area, Tensioning of subscap, Sling effect by conjoint tendon, Coracoacromial ligament reinforce anterior capsule
        
        ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - **Bristow vs laterjet** = bristow only transfer tip, resected surface in contact w glenoid.
- How do you make the laterjet coracoid cut? [HK]
    - The pec minor, CA and trapezoid ligaments will be incisied
    - Conoid ligaments is left intact at the base
- What is remplissage?
    - Tenodesis of the Infraspinatus into the hill sach lesion
    - Works by filling up the defect and prevent engagement
        
        ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%208.png)
        
- What is inferior capsular shift?
    - Closure of rotator interval
    - It is done either open or arthroscopically

---

- What is the incidence of rotator cuff tear in an elderly shoulder dislocation?
    - Up to 86% has been reported
- What is difference between chronic vs neglected dislocation?
    - neglected = months - years
    - chronic = weeks to months
- What do you expect to find in neglected dislocation?
    - Expect good ROM! - glenoid has grind out the hill sach lesion

## SHOULDER FRACTURE DISLOCATION of GT

- What are the potential blocks to reduction?
    - Long head of biceps

### Posterior Shoulder Instability

- Causes of posterior dislocation?
    - Trauma is still the most common
    - Seizure, lightning strike, electric shock, Electroconvulsion therapy
        - ** Even in **epilepsy, frequency of anterior and posterior dislocation is the SAME**. [There is no condition that leads to posterior dislocation being more common)
- ‼️ What is the classic clinical findings?
    - Loss of supination in the forearm with the elbow flexed
    - Described by Rowe and Zarin
- What is the classic XR findings?
    - Radiological features – light bulb sign
- ‼️ Acute Mx of an Dislocation of KNOWN and ACUTE duration?
    - OK to Attempt closed reduction
    - Reduction technique = **DePalma** Technique
        
        ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%209.png)
        
        - Beach chair position
        - Arm is **adducted** and **internally rotated**
        - With Caudal **traction**
        - While maintaining traction and IR **push medial aspect of arm laterally,** disengaging the Head
    - Treat underlying seizure
    - Post reduction - **gunslinger** brace to keep arm ER and abducted - to prevent arm from going into IR and hinging again
- Acute Mx of an dislocation of UNKNOWN Duration
    - concerned of a "locked posterior dislocation" ➔ risk of proximal humerus fracture if attempt closed reduction
    - I will get advanced imaging overnight
    - List in next morning trauma list for senior shoulder surgeon
- What if fail reduction? How to do open?
    - Open reduction via deltopectoral approach
    - If unable to reduce, **DO NOT DO SUBSCAPULARIS TENOTOMY** [immediate failure] as this is the salvage procedure (Mclaughlin procedure)
    - Can attempt reduction via **rotator interval OR do a LT osteotomy in case for Mclaughlin**
- ‼️ How do you manage a unstable posterior dislocation with big reverse hill sach? [Management ladder]
    - **Small** defect < 25% = reverse remplissage
    - Defect **25-50%** = **Mclaughlin** procedure
        - Osteotomy of LT and detached into defect
    - If **defect larg**e >50%
        - Femoral head **allograft** to cover defect
    - if **even bigger or unstable**
        - **Derotational** Osteotomy
        - Derotate the humeral head such that the reverse hill sach lesion is out of the way
    - **Final salvage** is reverse total shoulder arthroplasty
- What is reverse remplissage procedure?
    - Subscapularis transfer into reverse hill sach lesion
        
        ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- What is Mclaughlin procedure?
    - LT osteotomy and transfer into reverse hill sach lesion
        
        ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- **Inferior dislocation aka** Luxatio erecta?
    - Rare ++ due to hyperabduction of shoulder
    - Greatest incidence of NV injury of all types of dislocations
    - Presents with arm abducted and elevated above shoulder
    - Reduce under GA

### Labral Tears

- ‼️ What classification of labral tears?
    - Original Snyder Classification
    
    ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    - **Type 1** - superior labral **fraying**
    - **2** - **detachment** of superior labrum biceps anchor [most common]
    - **3** **bucket handle type tear** of SL with **intact** biceps anchor
    - **4** - bucket handle tear of SL with **extension** in biceps anchor
- Which phase of throwing does SLAP tear occur?
    - Late cocking phase - “peel-back” mechanism
- What clinical test?
    - O’brien test - Arm FF 90 °, adducted 10deg and max IR and resist downward force.
    - Pain relieved with ER = +ve
- Management?
    - Snyder 2 - controversial
        - Schroder 2017 BJSM. RCT comparing labral repair vs temodesis vs sham. No difference in outcomes.
    - Types 1,3 - debride frayed areas

### GIRD (Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit)

![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%2013.png)

- What is the pathoanatomy of GIRD?
    - Due to repititve throwing, tightening of posterior-inferior capsule leads to anterior superior translation of humeral head (translation is in the opposite direction from capsular tightening)
    
    ![Untitled](Labral%20Pathology%20-%20Anterior%20Instability%20Posterior%20%20789a10b69ed143fea07a2555e46f3a2c/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    - ‼️ During late cocking, **posterior rotator cuff** is impinged against the **posteriosuperior glenoid**
