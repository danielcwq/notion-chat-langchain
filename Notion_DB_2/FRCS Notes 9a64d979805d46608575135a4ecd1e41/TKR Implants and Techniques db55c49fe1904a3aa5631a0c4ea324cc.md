## TKR Implants

- 2 Knee biomechanics to replicate?
    - **Femoral roll back** = posterior translation of of femur on tibia in flexion
        - This means the tibial surface must be relatively flat and less conforming
        - In PS knees, this is achieved with the femoral cam coming into contact with tibia post
    - **Screw Home Mechanism**
- What is the condylar compromise?
    - The “condylar compromise” - A balance between constraint, kinematics and contact stresses
        - The principle is that the more normal we want the kinematics, the lower the constraint of the implant to allow movement (e.g. flat tibia tray) but this increases the higher contact stress.
        - To reduce contact stress, then we need more conformity of the implants - this increases constraint and thus reduce kinematics
- Levels of constraint
    - Unicondylar
    - Mobile Bearing design
        - Theoretical advantages of reduction in shear stresses and subsequent wear as the tibial insert will rotate on a smooth tibial platform
        - JBJS Meta-analysis of 6000 TKRs shows no difference between mobile vs fixed bearing TKR
        - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23997134/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23997134/)
    - Cruciate Retaining
        - Pros – bone preserving, more proprioception with PCL, avoids post-cam impingement
    - PS aka Cruciate sacrificing
        - Pros – easier to balance, more congruent joint surface,
        - Cons – cam jump, tibia post wear
    - Anterior Stabilized
        - Uses CR component and PCL is removed
        - Instead, PE has raised anterior lip that is more conforming and resists anterior translation
        - (-) Due to more conforming PE ➔ higher surface area ➔ higher PE wear debris
    - **Constrained condylar knee** (PS with post) - LCCK (legacy constrained condylar knee)
    - Rotating Hinged
    - F/E hinged
- All-PE vs metal backed modular design in tibia component?
    - All- PE (+) - lower costs, no back side wear (so no osteolysis), thicker PE
    - All -PE (-) - no modularity (less options), no liner exchange procedure for PJI, potential difficulty to remove, theoretically allows thicker PE to be used
- What material are the TKR implants?
    - Femur - Cobalt chrome
    - Tibia - Titanium (or cobalt chrome)
    - Patella - titanium
- Radius of femur component – single vs Multi?
    - Multi radius means 2 radii of curvature
        - Large anterior Radius
        - Small posterior Radius
    - Multi radius theoretically allow better femoral roll back in flexion
- What is Medial Pivot Knee?
    - More conforming medial component and less conforming lateral compartment, to place COR on medial aspect of knee
    - To replicate screw home mechanism
- When do you use **Stems**?
    - Used when there is high implant bone interface stresses in constraint implants ➔ distributes stresses over larger surface area
    - Pros
        - Resist shear forces
        - Increased stability by reducing micromotion
        - Reduce tibia lift off (experienced in V/V instablity)
    - Cons
        - Stress shielding ➔ reduced bone density ➔ theoretical risk of loosening, fracture and end-of-stem pain
        - Makes revision more difficult; less bone stock
- Types of **patella** components?
    - Symmetrical dome vs asymmetrical anatomical design
    - All PE components as previous metal backed prosthesis high failure rates in 1980s
    - Evolvement - multiple small pegs instead of single large peg
- Femoral **trochlea** component design evolvement?
    - More anatomic trochlear groove
    - Broad and deep groove to accomodate patellar component throughout ROM
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled.png)
        
- When do you use hinged implants? Indications for Hinged TKR?
    - 1. Global instability from infection/ trauma
    - 2. Hyperextension instablity e.g. Post polio
- ⚠️ ‼️ What do you know of the Knee Arthroplasty Trial?
    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19122088/#:~:text=Results%3A%20Functional%20status%20and%20quality,34.82%20points%20at%20two%20years).&text=Conclusions%3A%20Patients%20have%20substantial%20improvement%20following%20total%20knee%20replacement](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19122088/#:~:text=Results%3A%20Functional%20status%20and%20quality,34.82%20points%20at%20two%20years).&text=Conclusions%3A%20Patients%20have%20substantial%20improvement%20following%20total%20knee%20replacement).
    - JBJS 2009 Mutlicenter RCT of 2353 patients with 116 surgeons
    - **Compared patellar resurfacing, mobile bearing and metal backing**
    - 2 year results show **no difference** in functional outcome for these 3 factors

### IMPLANT Choice

There are 3 components in the implant choice - **CR vs PS**, **Patellar** resurfacing and the **type** of bearing

- What TKR implant **PS vs CR** will you choose?
    - I will use a CR knee because this is that i am trained in; UNLESS inflammatory arthritis or deficient PCL/ previous patellectomy
        - + Bone preserving procedure no need for box cut, preserves proprioceptive properties of the PCL.
        - As well as its consistent good results in national registries
    - AOJNRR 15 years significantly lower revision rates in CR  **7% vs 8%**
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-08 at 12.47.58 PM.png](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Screenshot_2022-08-08_at_12.47.58_PM.png)
        
- What **bearing** surface for TKR?
    - I will use a normal UHMWPE (non HXL) due to the different loading mechanisms as compared to the hip
        - Hip - high congruity with large surface area of contact. Superior shear resistance of XLPE is offset by its brittleness due to large surface area
        - Knee - Round on flat surface resulting in low surface area of contact and thus may predispose to contact stress and loading resulting in catastrophic failure
    - However, I am aware of the improving wear properties and brittle profile and is being more popularized in the Australian registry has rose to more than 60% in the last 10 years. AOJNRR also shows better revision rates (4.9 vs 7.8%) with HXLPE)
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-08 at 12.15.06 PM.png](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Screenshot_2022-08-08_at_12.15.06_PM.png)
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-08 at 12.50.46 PM.png](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Screenshot_2022-08-08_at_12.50.46_PM.png)
        
    - However, NJR shows conflicting results
        - Thomas Patridge et al. 2020 JBJS NJR study
        - No difference in revision rates at 12 years XLPE vs Conventional PE. However certain subset of patients **< 60 yo** and **BMI > 35** and the **second generation XLPE** demonstrated better survival
        - Because of increased cost, routine use of HXLPE may not be juustified
    
- Will you do **patellar resurfacing**?
    - I will do selective resurfacing for my patients in severe patellar wear or Rheumatoid arthritis
    - As i am aware of the risks this procedure
    - the KAT trial did not find any difference in resurfacing up to 2 years.
    - Meta-analysis of RCTs JBJS 2012 Pilling et al. No difference in anterior knee pain, functional scores or satisfaction
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%203.png)
        
    - Also aware that AOJNRR found **lower rate of revision compared to procedures without resurfacing.**
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Technique
        - Ensure remnant thickness **not less than 12mm**
        - Position – medialize it to prevent instability
- Fixed or mobile bearing for TKR?
    - I use fixed bearing with higher articular congruity of the PE
    - Based on AOJNRR, **fixed bearing have significantly lower revision** rates than mobile bearing 8.3 vs 9.5%
    - No difference in the KAT
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-08 at 12.17.56 PM.png](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Screenshot_2022-08-08_at_12.17.56_PM.png)
        
- Cemented vs uncemented TKR?
    - I will do cemented
    - Supported by AOJNR - lower revision rates at 18 years 7% vs 10%
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-08-08 at 12.30.12 PM.png](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Screenshot_2022-08-08_at_12.30.12_PM.png)
    

---

- What type of UKA will you do?
    - Fixed bearing **[ZUK]**  because this is what i am trained in
    - + lower risk of bearing dislocation
    - In addition supposed by the AOJNRR - no difference in revision rates
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-08-08 at 1.11.00 PM.png](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Screenshot_2022-08-08_at_1.11.00_PM.png)
        

## TKR Techniques

- Goals of TKR?
    - "Clinical (pain free, mobile knee) and mechanical goals"
    - 4 Goals
    - Restore mechanical **alignment**
    - Restore **joint line** perpendicular to mechanical axis
    - Achieve **soft tissue balance**
    - And restore normal **Q angle** and joint alignment
- What approaches?
    
    ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - Medial parapatellar
    - Subvastus
        - Preserves quads strength, preserves vascularity
    - Midvastus
        - Preserves lateral half of VMO insertion
    - Lateral parapatella
- What are the Extensile maneuver?
    
    ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - Quad snip
    - VY turn down
    - Tibial tuberosity osteotomy (TTO)
- ‼️ What alignment methods are you aware of?
    - Kinematic vs Mechanical Alignment
    - **Mechanical Axis Method** = cut femur and tibia both perpendicular to MA (more commonly used)
    - **Kinematic Axis Method** = cutting femur in 9 deg valgus (3 deg more) and tibia in 3 deg varus to re-establish the normal joint line orientation  which is **3 degree varus**
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%207.png)
        
- ‼️ Tell me about the 5 cuts in TKR?
    - 1. Distal femur cut = Distal femur cut [**CORONAL**]
        - Done with IM jig, set to 6 degrees valgus (difference between AA and MA) ➔ becomes perpendicular to MAF
        - Cut less if there is valgus knee (hypoplastic femoral condyle)
        - The **taller the person, the smaller the angle**
            
            ![Screenshot 2022-08-17 at 7.57.17 AM.png](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Screenshot_2022-08-17_at_7.57.17_AM.png)
            
    - 2. Distal femur anterior and posterior cuts - this determines rotation [**ROTATION**]
        - To this cut, one must use the 4 in one cutting guide.
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%208.png)
        
        - But the to place the 4 in one guide in the right position, we need to:
            1. Get the rotation correct
            2. Get the size correct
        - Assess rotation by looking at 3 lines – Whiteside’s AP line, transepicondylar, Posterior condylar axis
            - Perpendicular to Whitesides line
            - Parallel to Transepicondylar line
            - 3 ° external rotation this is because tibia plateau is in 3 degrees of varus
                
                ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%209.png)
                
            - Do not use posterior condyles in lateral condyle hypoplasia in valgus knee
        - Assess size by anterior or posterior referencing methods
    - 3. Femur Chamfer cuts +/- box cut
    - 4. Proximal tibia cut = Cut perpendicular to AA (AA = MA in tibia) [**CORONAL**, **SAGITTAL**]
        - Done with EM jig, align to tibia crest and center of ankle
        - Controls for VV and Tibia slope
        - Tibia slope 3-5 degrees
    - 5. Tibia Keel punch [**ROTATION**]
        - Prior to this, we adjust rotation by puting trial implant, flex and extend knee till auto adjusted
        - Make a mark at tibial tuberosity (typically medial 1/3), then align keel punch to it.
- What is Whitesides line?
    - A line drawn from the **deepest part of the trochlea groove** to the centre of the **intercondylar notch** posteriorly
    - It is perpendicular to the transepicondylar line
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- ‼️ How do you ensure correct rotation of implant?
    - Intraop Alignment - with 3 lines before anterior and posterior cuts
    - Implant positioning - avoid medialization and IR of tibia and femur implants [Avoid functional increase in Q angle]
    - Avoid lateralization of patellar component
    - Intraop assessment - release tourniquet and assess maltracking (Study found that tournique deflation leads to better tracking and saved 30% of releases - JOA Husted et al.
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- ‼️ Do you use **anterior referencing** or posterior referencing?
    - Anterior referencing uses a boom = means cut posterior = prevents notching but risk of increasing flexion gap
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%2012.png)
        
    - Posterior referencing = cut anterior = risk of notching but flexion gap is controlled
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%2013.png)
        
    - I usually use anterior referencing
- ‼️ Gap balancing vs Measured resection?
    - **Measured resection** = bone cuts made with bony landmarks
    - **Gap balancing** = equalising soft tissue tension before doing bone cuts
    - **I use the measured resection technique**, whereby, my bone cuts are made independant of soft tissue tension but based on the 3 lines, then a spacer block is used to examine the flexion and extension gaps.
    - On the other hand, in Gap balancing, soft tissue tension is assumed to be correct (its not altered) and its used to determine bony cuts
    - Studies show no difference
    
    [MR vs GB.pdf](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/MR_vs_GB.pdf)
    
    [GB vs MR no diff.pdf](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/GB_vs_MR_no_diff.pdf)
    
- How do you do Gap balancing after measured resection?
    - Aim is to make the flexion and extension gaps rectangular and equal
    - **McPherson's Rule**
    
    ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    - Flexion Gap is controlled by = posterior femur cut, tibia cut, PCL (if tight flexion gap, can release PCL just enough to reduce tightness)
        
        ![Untitled](TKR%20Implants%20and%20Techniques%20db55c49fe1904a3aa5631a0c4ea324cc/Untitled%2015.png)
        
    - Extension Gap is controlled by distal femur cut, tibia cut and posterior capsule
- What does a loose extension gap mean?
    - Indicates excessive distal femoral resection
    - Distal femoral augmentation required
- What does loose flexion gap [flexion instability] mean?
    - Indicates undersizing of implant, incompetent PCL or excessive tibia slope
    - Need to augment posterior femor condyle or shift the femur component posteriorly while being careful there is no notching
    - Can also increase the extension gap by cutting distal femur, then use a overall thicker poly
- Patellar denervation?
    - No consensus on this practice. Theoretically, electrocautery denervates patellar, reducing pain
    - However aware of study by Gupta et al. 2010 JBJS showing no difference between denerve vs no denerve in terms of pain
- How to prevent popliteal artery injury?
    1. **Stay medial to PCL.** with single prong retractor (do not go lateral to PCL)
        - Popliteal artery **is a lateral structure** at level of joint line
    2. **Flexion** brings popliteal artery further away
- How do you address FFD in tkr?
    - Resect distal femur for more extension gap (every 10 deg, cut more by 2mm)
    - Sequence of release of posterior impingement
    - Osteophytes ➔ posterior capsule ➔ gastric muscle origin

- ‼️ Complications of TKR?
    - [PS knees] Femoral Cam Jump 2° to loose flexion gap
    - [PS knees] Patellar clunk syndrome - suprapatellar fibrous nodule
        - **Fibrous nodul**e at junction of posterior superior aspect of patellar and quads tendon ➔ repeated entrapment ➔ inflammation and synovial proliferation ➔ pain
        - Mx
            - Non op
            - Arthroscopic debridement
    - [PS knees] Tibia post fracture 2° to hyperextension 2° loose extension gap, excessive posterior slope
    - Aseptic loosening
    - Instability - can be caused by loosening
        - Types
            - Extension instability
            - Mid- flexion instability
            - Loose fleion gap/ ruptured PCL
            - Flexion instability
            - Excess flexion gap
            - Recurvatum common in NM disorders e.g. Polio
        - Mx = KIV revision – may need constrained knee
    - Dis-sastification rate - 10-20%
    - DVT
    - Notching - lessens the load needed to cause a fracture
    - Common peroneal nerve palsy - especially valgus knees
    - Vascular injury
- Patient has “noise around knee” what is it?
    - Patellar clunk
    - Diagnosis - painful, palpable catch as knee **extends** at 40 ° flexion
- What are risk factors for patellar clunk?
    - Pre op factors - Patella baja
    - Implant factors - PS > CR,
    - Surgeon factors -
        - Femur tibia - increased posterior femoral condylar offset, femoral component in flexed position
        - patellar - Low patellar component exposing **unresurfaced superior pole**

- How does navigation help in TKR?
    - Reduces outliers in Coronal plane alignment
    
    [Less outliers in pinless navigation compared with conventional surgery in total knee arthroplasty - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23455388/)
    

### Blood Loss Management

- What is the standard amount of blood loss in TKR?
    - 500ml to 1L
    - Expect drop of 1 to 3gram Hb/dl
- ‼️ How do you reduce blood loss in TKR?
    - **Preop** – optimize Hb, anemia screening, Chronic disease optimisation (CKD, sickle cell)
    - **Intraop** –
        - IV TXA as per NICE guidelines,
        - Tourniquet
        - cell saver
        - Good hemostasis
    - **Post op** – avoid drain

- Will you use a drain?
    - I will not insert a drain
    - [Cochrane review by Martyn Parker 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408575/) – No difference in infection, hematoma, wound dehiscence, reoperations BUT more blood transfusions with drain.

- Will you give TXA?
    - Results consistent in showing TXA reduces transfusion requirments
    - **NICE Guidelines - to give IV TXA and  1g intra-articular** after final washout. [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng157/chapter/Recommendations#tranexamic-acid-to-minimise-blood-loss](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng157/chapter/Recommendations#tranexamic-acid-to-minimise-blood-loss)
    - Method of administration IV (high vs low dose 1g) vs Topical (high vs low dose 1.5g) all no difference
    - Topical is given diluted in NS and injected into joint with or without drain
- Do tourniquet reduce blood loss?
    - Yes. It can reduce post op blood loos
    - BUT does not decrease rate of transfusion
    
    [The effects of tourniquet use on blood loss in primary total knee arthroplasty for patients with osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839231/)
    

## TKR CONSIDERATIONS

- Bilateral simultaneous TKR?
    - Controversial. Can consider if significant FFD and varus that will affect rehab
    - Meta-analysis by HSS 2013 shows **increased mortaility** rates at 30days, 3 months, 1 year
    - 2021 Journal of Arthroplasty Metaanalysis Makaram et al.
        - Decreased infection, and LOS
        - But **increased 90-day mortality**, DVT
        - Similar revision rates.
- TKR in **obese** patients?
    - WHO definition BMI > 30
    - Considerations
        - Preop weight loss program
        - Plan for manpower
        - IV Abx according to weight
        - Longer incision for exposure
        - Navigation – potentially reduce op time and improve alignment
        - DVT – obesity is risk factor
    - Prophylactic stem use?
        - Steere et al 2018. BMI > 35, no difference failure rates stem vs no stem.
    - Outcomes
        - Increased risk of infection, loosening, revision

### Previous Patellectomy

- What surgeries in the past were done with transverse scar?
    - Patellectomy
    - Patella fractures - used to be done with transverse scars
- What do you expect to find in patients with patellectomy?
    - Extensor lag
- What indications for patellectomy today?
    - OM of patella
    - Severe comminution
    - Tmor of patella

- What are the considerations for future TKR in patient with patellectomy?
    - **Standard PS knee** without reconstruction due to unpredictable PCL function (effects of patellectomy) Outcomes?
        - Intact patella has superior outcomes. Arc of flexion less, complication rates (instability, infection)
        - Infection higher may be due to subtle instability
    - **OR recontruct patellar** with femoral condyle (when doing distal femur cut), fresh frozen allograft
