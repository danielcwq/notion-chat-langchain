Topic: Paeds

1. Goals = Stable, concentrically reduced hip to allow normal acetabular development to prevent DJD
2. 1 = pain relief, analgesia
3. 2 = assess ROM, maintain with physio
4. 3 = look for at risk signs 

- Why Perthes occur in this age group?
    - Blood supply

- ‼️ ⚠️ How do you assess a child with a limp? Differentials?
    - I want to rule out TIT, with Hx, PE and Investigations first
    - Infection - bloods, Trauma - hx and XR, Tumor in this age group, conerned about hematological tumors - do peripheral blood film
    - **Perthes** - usually **painless** limp. Ddx **Congenital Coxa Vara!**
- Why does Hip pathology lead to knee pain?
    - Obturator and Femoral nerves supply the hip capsule anteriorly
    - In the knee, anterior fibers originate from femoral nerves while posterior fibers originate from obturator nerves

    - Thus, referred pain
- What is Perthes Disease?
    - It is idiopathic AVN of femoral head
    - The course of disease is 2 years "we cannot do anything about the AVN, but we can mould it during the remodelling stage"
- What are the differential diagnosis of perthes?
    - Trauma, Infection, Tumor
    - If Bilateral, TRO MED, SED (skeletal survey XR)
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the risk factors of Perthes?
    - Family history, low birth weight, low social economic background
    - Underlying coagulopathies - Thrombophilia, sickle cell anemia
- ‼️ What clinical findings? Which ROM is limited?
    - Tendelenburg gait
    - If presence of hinge abduction, there will be **limited Abduction** and **flexion-adduction contracture** of the hip with apparent shortening and ipsilateral genu valgum
- What is hinge abduction?
    - During fragmentation stage, in some cases, the
    anterolateral osteocartilaginous part of the deformed femoral head protrudes outside the acetabulum, impinging
    against its lateral lip during hip abduction.
    - As a consequence, the femoral head moves eccentrically instead of concentrically within the acetabulum, with widening of the inferomedial joint space and further reduction of the superolateral joint space.

- What are the classical XR features to mention?
    - "Global" reduced height of epiphysis

- ‼️ Why is there widened medial joint space?
    - Because cartilaginous part of the femoral head continues growing while the osseous part does not due to AVN. It is not because head is subluxating!
    - "Space is never enlarged because of fluid except in the neonate. The hip ligaments are very strong"
    - Cartilage nutrition does not depend on blood supply but from the synovial fluid so it does not stop growing
- What is the best way to detect subluxation?
    - Shenton's line.
- ‼️ What are the stages of this disease?
    - **Waldenstrom** Stages
    
    ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - 1. **Necrotic** stage (~6 month) = [XR shows globally reduced but no collapse]
    - 2. **Fragmentation** (~6 month) - early vs late
        - EARLY - hallmark is **crescent sign** = subchondral collapse on frog leg lateral
            
            ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%207.png)
            
        - LATE
    - 3. **Reossification** (~18 month)
    - 4. **Remodelling** (~3 year)
- ‼️How do you classify severity?
    - Herring **Lateral** Pillar
        
        ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%208.png)
        
        - Divide into 3 pillars; Look at the lateral pillar which acts a buttress to lateral subluxation
        - A = no loss of height
        - B = **< 50%** loss of height
        - B/C = “poor ossification”
        - C = **> 50%** loss of height
    - Catterall Classification
        - Looking if < 50% or > 50% head involvement
        
        ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%209.png)
        
- How to differentiate **early vs late fragmentation**?
    - Early fragmentation - looking at **Crescent sign** on frog leg lateral
        
        ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Salter thompson classifiction - to classify size of CRESCENT sign
        
        ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%2011.png)
        
    - Late fragmentation - collapse already occur
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the Hip at risk signs (by Catterall)? (5)
    
    ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    - 1. **Gage’s** sign = v shape at lateral epiphysis
    - 2. Metaphyseal **cysts**
    - 3. **Horizontal** physis
    - 4. **Calcification** lateral to epiphysis
    - 5. Lateral **extrusion** (global increase in size)/ subluxation (will get contracture in iliopsoas and adductors) - most significant
    - Subluxation - Shenton line disrupted
    - Clinically - Limited ROM
    - Gage - yes, Cysts - yes, Horizontal - yes, No calcification, no subluxation, extrusion - yes
- ‼️ What is the **Stulberg** Classification?
    
    ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%2013.png)
    
    - Stulberg 1 - spherical
    - Stulberg 2 - spherical but **coxa magna** ➔ risk of FAI, labral tears due to large head OR Coxa Breva (short neck)
    - Stulberg 3 - non spherical
    - Stulberg 4 - non spherical with **Coxa Plana**
    - Stulberg 5 - non congruent
- When does Coxa magna correlate to the Stulberg?
    - Based on Rowe et al. 2005 paper which looked at the relation of Magna with eventual OA, found that out of 85 hips,
        - **58 were in Stulberg 1 and 2,**
        - 27 in 3 and 4,
        - none in Stulberg 5
    - 41% of patients with coxa magna had poor outcomes

- What are the outcomes of each Stulberg stage?
    - 1 and 2 good outcomes; big drop in outcomes for Stulberg 3-5

- ‼️ What is the Herring's paper in 2004?
    - 438 patients, comparing 5 treatments - no treatment vs brace vs PT, vs femoral osteotomy vs pelvis osteotomy
    - **Results:**
    1. Treatment has **no effect on children < 8 yo**. Regardless of Lateral herring Classification
    2. In **Children > 8 yo**, surgery beneficial for B and B/C. But if Lateral C, because already poor prognosis, no difference
- ‼️ What is the goal of treatment in Perthes?
    - Achieve containment in the fragmentation stage to allow remodelling to achieve a Stulberg 1,2 Spherical, congruent head

## SCENARIO: < 8yo [Herring]

- How will you manage a < 8 yo with Perthes?
    - Goal is provide containment to achieve Stulberg 1, 2 Hip to prevent secondary OA
    - Treatment is activity modification and maintainance of ROM with PT

## SCENARIO > 8yo [Herring]

- How will you manage > 8yo with perthes?
    - A and C ➔ conservative
    - B or B/C ➔ Containment Surgery
        
        ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- What are the containment surgeries?
    - Proximal femoral varus osteotomy
    - Salter Pelvic re-orientation osteotomies [Paeds Hip/ Pelvic Osteotomies](Paeds%20Hip%20Pelvic%20Osteotomies%204afb04e7dc824c149ce4d284b151a893.md)
- Why does the GT overgrowth? How to manage?
    - GT has separate extracapsular blood supply ➔ unaffected growth in perthes ➔ **Relative overgrowth** compared to head and neck
    - Causes weakness of abductors, extra-articular impingement between GT and ilium
    - **Management:**
        - Prevention with eiphysiodesis (argued to be less invasive). Many techniques:
            
            ![Untitled](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%2017.png)
            
        - Mx = Distal and lateral advancement of GT

## > 10 YO OR ADULT PERTHES HIP

![In this case, there is likely hinge abduction ➔ likely limited ROM and limited abduction, with trendlenburg gait ➔ will require VALGUS osteotomy](Perthes%2036517696f95d43478a37f364ae3160b8/Untitled%2018.png)

In this case, there is likely hinge abduction ➔ likely limited ROM and limited abduction, with trendlenburg gait ➔ will require VALGUS osteotomy

- Why > 10 year old, we see them differently?
    - If onset is 7 years old, then by 10 years, it would be in reossification stage ➔ no more consideration of containment
- What salvage procedures?
    - Femoral valgus osteotomy
    - Acetabular salvage osteotomies (shelf or Chiari) [Paeds Hip/ Pelvic Osteotomies](Paeds%20Hip%20Pelvic%20Osteotomies%204afb04e7dc824c149ce4d284b151a893.md)
- What are the various shapes of the head?
    - Coxa **Breva** = short neck
        - [Congenital Hip Conditions - PFFD, Coxa Vara + Coxa Breva                                                                              ](Congenital%20Hip%20Conditions%20-%20PFFD,%20Coxa%20Vara%20+%20Coxa%204f7f2b96edf6410588235128cac11004.md)
    - Coxa **Magna** = large head = **Stulberg 2**
    - Coxa **Plana** = flat head (According to Arjandas very specific for Perthes) = **Stulberg 4**
    - **Sagging Rope** sign = A huge FAI due to impaction anteriorly when child flexes
- What is the **sagging rope** sign?

    - It is a thin opaque line in the upper femoral metaphysis
    - Found only when epiphysial disorder is associated with changes in growth plate
    - It indicates that the disease was **severe and growth plate damaged**
    - Expect to see progressive shortening and varus deformity of the proximal femur as well as GT relative overgrowth
    - It may be analogous to the Harris’ line of growth inhibition and subsequent recover of growth in the long limbs. Not only found in Perthes but also in other conditions that may affect growth plates
        - MED, SED
