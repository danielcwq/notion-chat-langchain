## P - Neck of femur Fracture (‼️)

- **NEED TRO NAI**
- ‼️ Classification of paeds NOF fracture?
    - **Delbet’s** (prognosticates risk of AVN)
        
        ![Untitled](P%20Femur%20and%20Patella%20Fractures%20a1ff31dc03764cdf8781ad337124e2d2/Untitled.png)
        
    - Type 1 = **Transphyseal** [SH-1] (100%)
    - Type 2 = **Transcervical** (50%) - most common
    - 3 = **Basicervical** (25%)
    - 4 = **Intertrochanteric** (10%)
- ‼️ Management for child < 4 yo?
    - Non Op with **hip Spica**
- ‼️ Mx for child > 4 year old?
    - Type 1 = 2 smooth pins or **transphyseal** screws
    - Type 2/ 3 = 6.5mm Screws
        - < 10 yo - **Physeal sparing** screws if 4 - 9 yo (if sufficient metaphysis)
        - > 10 yo - **Transphyseal** screws (better purchase)
    - Type 4 = **DHS**, proximal femoral locking plates
        - < 10yo physeal sparing
        - > 10yo - transphyseal
- Future complications?
    - AVN 20%
    - Coxa Vara 20%
    - Premature physeal closure ➔ coxa breva ➔ LLD
        - If partial physeal bar can lead to angular vara or valga deformity
    - Non- union

## P - Femur Shaft Fractures (‼️)

- Management for < 6 month old?
    - Pavlik Harness
    - Gallow's Traction [Traction Principles](Traction%20Principles%20423fc20063e54396ac90462664061b20.md)
- Management for 6 month - 5 yo?
    - Hip Spica
- Management for 5-12 yo?
    - **Submuscular plating** - usual option due to the desire not to disrupt the GT apophysis as well as the narrow intramedullary canal
    - **vs Nail** - unless patient is very close to maturity
- [TENS Nail Principles](https://www.notion.so/TENS-Nail-Principles-e917c0ec42e441f59c85a5712004c51b)

- What are predictors of poor outcomes of using TENS for paeds femur shaft fracture?
    - Moroz et al. JBJS 2006 of 234 femur shaft fractures
    - Poor outcomes 5 times more likely if **> 49kg or > 11 yo**
    - Distal femur 18% vs 9% has angulation malunion
    - Fracture pattern - spiral, comminuted fracture
- Management of > 12 yo?
    - < 50kg = TENS
    - > 50kg = Plate
    - if close to maturity = can use IMN
        - Pediatric nails are 7mm. So need to measure before op
- What are contraindications/ limitations to flexible nail for femur?
    - WEIGHT > 50kg based on Moroz et al. study of 234 patients. 5 times more likely of failure
    - Age > 11 yo, Moroz et al.
    - FRACTURE PATTERN - spiral, comminuted fractures
- Paeds femur intramedullary nail entry point?
    - Entry point options - **3 options** - piriformis, GT tip, Lateral GT.
    - Nail designs started off with P, then moved to GT Tip to prevent AVN. Then now Lateral GT to prevent AVN further. (Lateral entry still goes through the GT and thus will affect the apophysis)
    - (Synthes is lateral GT entry point)
- Rates of AVN of various entry points?
    - Macneil et al. JPO 2011 Systematic review
    - Piriformis entry point AVN rate 2%, tip of GT 1.4%, lateral GT 0%
- What other concerns for femur nail?
    - Diameter of nail may not be small enough.
    - Smallest is 7mm (synthes)
- Complications?
    - **Overgrowth** of femur is common especially if < 2 yo

## P - Distal Femur Fractures (‼️)

- Usually is Salter Harris what?
    - Mostly **SH-2** with metaphyseal fragment
- What is unique of the physis that causes higher risk of growth arrest?
    - Unique **UNDULATING** physis ➔ high risk of growth arrest and angular deformity!
- Management?
    - Mx is dependant on extent of displacement
    - < 2mm displacement = Non Op in cast
    - > 2mm displacement = ORIF
        - Cross pinning with smooth K-wire - **"2mm, cross above physis, bicortical"** (+ Easy removal, - Pin site infection)

        - OR Physeal sparing screws - 6.5mm screws
            
            ![Untitled](P%20Femur%20and%20Patella%20Fractures%20a1ff31dc03764cdf8781ad337124e2d2/Untitled%202.png)

- What complication is it at high risk of?
    - High risk of growth disturbance - LLD, angulation in up to 30-50%
        - If < 2cm projection at maturity = non Op
        - If > 2cm - epiphysiodesis
    - **Physeal bridge** with **angulation**
- "What happens when you get a physeal bar?"
    - It depends on the extent of the bar
    - If central/ complete ➔ LLD
    - if peripheral ➔ angular deformity
- Management of **LLD Physeal bar with no angulation** (This means complete or central)?
    - CT scan to evaluate size
    - < 40% central Bar ➔ Consider resection
    - > 40% ➔ No point resecting. Manage as per LLD:
    - GENERAL MX OF LLD [Limb Length Discrepancy (LLD), Hemihypertrophy and associated Syndromes](Limb%20Length%20Discrepancy%20(LLD),%20Hemihypertrophy%20and%209c6b92d367c84e3f8a93733b68a2915f.md)
- Management of **Angular Physeal Bar?**

## P-  Patellar Sleeve Avulsion

![Untitled](P%20Femur%20and%20Patella%20Fractures%20a1ff31dc03764cdf8781ad337124e2d2/Untitled%204.png)

- How do you know quickly this is Patella Alta?
    - Possible if knee is flexed about 30 deg ➔ Reference from the **Blumensaat line**; it should be inline with the inferior pole of the patella
        
        ![Untitled](P%20Femur%20and%20Patella%20Fractures%20a1ff31dc03764cdf8781ad337124e2d2/Untitled%205.png)
        
- What is patella sleeve avulsion?
    - Separation of cartilage sleeve from patellar ossified nucleus
    - Can be **inferior pole (more common)** or proximal pole
- How will you manage?
    - **Undisplaced (SLR ok)** = cylindrical cast for 4-6/52
    - **Displaced** (loss of extensor mechanism) = ORIF
        - Tension band OR Transosseous suturing (Gavin says now a days most use transosseous suturing)
            
            ![Untitled](P%20Femur%20and%20Patella%20Fractures%20a1ff31dc03764cdf8781ad337124e2d2/Untitled%206.png)
            
        - It is actually a large fragment not seen on XR
    - Local paper by Arjandas et al. 2008 follow up of 11 patients; 5 displaced needing TBW - good results in **TBW** with all having no pain of discomfort with FROM
    - KKH teaching - they still use TBW most of the time.
