## Anatomy of ACL

- What is the blood supply of the ACL?
    - It is intra-articular but extra-synovial
    - with Blood supply from the middle genicular artery
- What are the 2 bundles and their function?
    - 2 bundles - AM and PL bundle, referenced from tibial attachment
    - **AM** bundle tightens in flexion and resists **Anterior translation**
    - **PL** bundle tightens in extension and resists **rotation forces**
- Attachments of the 2 bundles?
    - On the **Femoral** side, it is attached below the lateral intercondylar ridge,
    - Divided into 2 bundles by the lateral bifurcate ridge
    -

    - On the **tibia** side, it is attached medial to the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus and posterior to the anterior horn of the medial meniscus

## ACL injuries

- Risk factors?
    - Females - 4:1 ratio. Multifactorial
        - Intrinsic - increased valgus, small notch, reduced ligament diameter
        - Hormone levels - link to menstruation cycles
        - Landing biomechanics?
        - Neuromuscular
- What is the mechanism of ACL injury?
    - Pivoting injury. Foot planted, knee goes into valgus, Femur Externally rotates on the tibia.

- Which meniscus is torn with ACL?
    - Acute - LM
    - Chronic - MM
- What is the O'Donoghue unhappy triad?
    - Described by O-Donochue in 1950, consists of ACL, MCL and Medial meniscus injury
    - However debunked recently as Lateral meniscus injuries occur more commonly.
- Natural history of ACL tear?
    - Noyes' Rule of thirds
    - 1/3 non copers
    - 1/3 copers with reduced activity
    - 1/3 copers can return to normal sports

- What are the special associated XR findings?
    - Segond's fracture [Anterolateral Ligament (ALL)](https://workflowy.com/#/df84cda60952)
    - Pellegrini Steida lesion [What is the pellegrini-stieda lesion?](https://workflowy.com/#/fb8a6a68e1a7)
- What is the MRI pattern of bone bruising?
    - Femur **external rotates** on the tibia (tibia is internally rotated - basis of pivot shift to sublux the tibia)
    
    ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - Edema is on the anterior aspect of Lateral femoral condyle and posterior aspect of tibia plateau

## CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT OF ACL

- Sequelae of not operating?
    - Risk of OA is controversial –
        - Yperen 20 year f/u no difference (but transtibial technique)
        - Thomas Sanders shows lower risk of symptomatic OA and meniscus tears with reconstruction
    - Risk of further medial meniscus tear
- Aware of evidence for non operative?
    - Landmark Frobell paper in NEJM
    - Found that rehab + delayed recon is not superior to early recon
    - Reccomended for trial of rehab first.

## CONSIDERATIONS for RECONSTRUCTION

- ‼️ What is the ideal timing for ACL recon?
    - **> 3 weeks** lowest incidence of Arthrofibrosis
    - **1991 landmark paper by Shelbourne** compared 3 groups of patients with different timing of surgery - < 1 week, < 3 week, > 3 week
        - Incidence of arthrofibrosis was significantly more in recon at < 1 week
        - Group 2 < 3 week depends on rehab program (accelerated better than conventional)
        - Concludes that ideal timing is > 3 weeks post injury
- What is your graft choice?
    - **Autograft** – hamstring, quads, BPTB (+ is bone to bone healing better incorporation; - is AKP)
    - **Allograft** do have a higher failure rate – over 4 x higher.
        - Failure rates more pronounced in younger patient < 20 (Kaeding 2011)
        
        ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%204.png)
        
        - Irradiation affects biomechanical properties negatively
        - If want to use allograft, **use non-irradiated allografts**
            - Chemically sterilized (bioCleanse)
            - Autograft vs NON irradiated allograft = no difference in outcome but still higher failure rates
- What are the relative tensile strengths of various grafts?
    - Native ACL 2100
    - BPTB 2600
    - Quadraple hamstring 4000N!
- What is an ideal graft size?
    - >8mm lowest revision rates (**Magnussen** et al)
    - OR 2.20 if < 8mm
    
    [Graft size and patient age are predictors of early revision after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring autograft - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22305299/)
    
- What technique will you use?
    - Positioning
        - Leg support
        - Foot support - able to hyper flex to prevent posterior blowout when drilling femur tunnel
    - Insertion points
        - Tibia – "within foot print" just adjacent to LM anterior horn; taking care clearance from meniscus (Dave: “As medial as possible”)
        - Femur – "anatomic center" Below resident ridge (intercondylar ridge), at the lateral bifurcate ridge; ensure sufficient buffer to prevent posterior blow out

        ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - **Transportal vs transtibial** – transtibial more vertical tunnel, less rotational stability;
    - Single bundle vs double bundle – better biomechanical stability but unsure clinical significance.
    - Notch plasty to remove osteophytes
- ‼️ Single bundle vs double bundle reconstruction?
    - Cochrane reviews 2012 - Insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of DB and SB reconstruction. Limited evidence that DB has some superior results in objective measurements of knee stability.
    - Freddie Fu AJSM 2012 - **RCT** of 281 cases with 3-6 year follow up. DB is superior in AP and rotational stability based on KT-1000 and pivot shift test. Differences are small and may not be clinically relevant.
- What graft fixation will you use?
    - **Suspensory** – endobutton (Bungee effect, windsheid wiper effect)
    - **Aperture** – screw with interference fit
    - Secondary fixation?
        - Staple, suture anchor
- ‼️ Tell me the basic science involvement in graft preparation?
    - **Pre-tensioning** – Done static on board and dynamic cycling, also at final tightening (~30 cycles)
        - Diminishes the crimp, such that when inserted, the tendon is taut
        - Stress relaxation = on the board, it is held at constant length ➔ stress in tendon drops
        - Creep = when doing cycling, constant force is exerted on the graft by pulling on it
    - All the above serves to insert the graft taut so that there will be minimal residual creep and stress relaxation
- What do you do if you drop the ACL graft?
    - I will cleanse it by soaking in 4% **chlrohexidine** for 30 minutes, followed by a triple antibiotic soak with **Gentamicin**, Clindamycin and Polymyxin (3 cins)
    - RCT by Molina et al. in Arthroscopy 2000 Compared soaking in 3 solutions for 90 seconds - Polymyxin, 10% Providone-iodine, 4% Chlorhexidine Gluconate
    - Untreated 58% positive, Iodine 24%, Abx 6%, Chlrohexidine 2%
    - Only 1 in 50 came back positive for Chlrohexidine. Chlorhexidine is best.
- Any augmentation techniques you know?
    - Lemaire Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis (LET)
    - Technique - ITB harvested proximally with distal end still at Gerdy's and attached to Lateral Fem Condyle

- ‼️ Describe the **stages of graft incorporation**?
    
    ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%208.png)
    
    ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%209.png)
    
    - **Inflammatory** – partial necrosis (6 week) - weakest phase
    - **Proliferation** – angiogenesis and revascularization (6 weeks)
        - Increase number of myofibroblasts
        - Depositing **type 3 collagen**
    - **Ligamentization (after 3 months)** – remodelling
        - Collagen fibres regain organization with parallel alignment
        - Reaches maximum properties at 1 year

- How does bone block in BTPB graft integrate?
    - Bone block undergoes **Creeping substitution**
    - Cancellous bone = By Creeping substitiution (3 stages)
        - 1:  Vascular ingrowth
        - 2: Osteoblasts lay new bone with simultaneous **stochastic** (aka random) resorption (Creeping Substitution)
        - 3: Remodelling via cutting cones
- What is your post op rehab?
    - Draw the ligamentization chart
    - **0-6 wk** - FWB, early ROM, Closed chain exerfoses (Foot is fixed on ground)[inflammatory] ,
    - **6wk - 3month** - Open chain exercises[Proliferation] ,
    - **> 3 month** Jogging [Ligamentization]
    - **4-6 month**  Sports Specific
    - **6- 12 month** - return to sports
- What complications?
    - Missed PLC
    - Tunnel complications
        
        ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%2010.png)
        
        - Problems with tunnel placement
            - Tibia - too anterior (extension notch impingement, tight in flexion), too posterior (impinge PCL)
            - Femur - too anterior (tight in flexion, lax in extension), too posterior (lax in flexion, tight in extension)
        - Posterior blow out if knee is not hyper flexed during femur tunnel reaming
        - Too vertical (definition = femoral tunnel divergent < 30 °)
    - Post Op
        - Cyclops lesion
            - Cyclops lesion or localized anterior arthrofibrosis, is a fibrous nodule located in the intercondylar notch anterior to the ACL graft; blocks extension
            - This is a infrapatellar nodule (as opposed to patellar clunk which is suprapatella)
            - Mx = arthroscopic debridement
    - Patient related
        - Non compliant PT
        - Mal-aligned limb - risk of retear
- Patient had ACL reconstruction and now knee is stiff. How will you approach?
    - Assess with triple assesement - Hx, PE Invx
    - Firstly, i want to rule out any infection - clinically and biochemically if necessary
    - Next, was the stiffness **interval onset or right after op?**
        - Immediately after op - aberrant tunnel placement, overtensioning, notch impingement
        - Interval onset - arthrofibrosis, cyclops lesion
    - Invx - MRI scsn
- What are the outcomes of ACL reconstruction?
    - 20 year graft survival is 86%
- What happens to ACL reconstruction if you don’t repair meniscus?
    - ? Medial meniscus confers AP stability, so if don't repair, you lose a secondary stabilizer to protect the recon
- What happens with wrong tunnel position?
    - Tibia
        - Too anterior = impingement in extension
        - Too posterior = Tight in extension
    - Femur
        - Too anterior = Tight in flexion; lax in extension
        - Too posterior = tight in extension; lax in flexion

## REVISION ACL

- What are the 3 types of graft motion?
    - Windshield wiper effect - horizontal
    - Bungee effect - longitudinal
    - Creep - elongation
- Approach to case of re-ruptured ACL?
    - **Hx - Reasons** for re-rupture – traumatic, technical (tunnel position), missed PLC, TRO infection
    - **PE -** Dial test to evaluate PLC, ADT, Lachmann
    - **Invx** previous tunnels - CT scan to evaluate bone loss
        - **Tibia** – should be posterior and parallel to Blaumensaat line at 30 °
            
            ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%2011.png)
            
        - **Femur** –
            - Sagittal intersection between posterior cortex and blaumensaat line,
            - Coronal – assess verticality and divergence
    - Bone stock/ widening – KIV 2 stage bone grafting
    - Consider LET for further constraint
- Mx – 3 Scenarios?
    - If tunnel position is poor = just remake new tunnels
    - If tunnel position is good = can reuse; upsize
    - If tunnel position is good but bone loss - consider single or 2 stage bone grafting
    - Consider LET

## ACL RECON IN IMMATURE PATIENTS

- Aware of physeal sparing approach?
    - **Kocher** technique (modification of the Macintosh technique) - involves ITB harvested proximally, loop around femoral lateral femoral condyle, goes into notch and attaches to proximal tibia
        
        ![Untitled](ACL%20Injuries%202cbc55d1545f4ec8ae7baeb25e63ee31/Untitled%2012.png)
        
        - kocher2006.pdf
    - **Macintosh** procedure - Multiple descriptions and modications - principle is using the ITB, to reinforce lateral ligaments to act as a restraint to internal rotation of tibia
        - 20cm strip of ITB dissected from mid portion of ITB, passed deep to the collateral ligament and a subperiosteal tunnel and then inserted into the lateral femoral condyle.
- Transphyseal technique considerations?
    - Limit tunnel diameter to < 8mm
    - Drill tunnels at lower speed
    - Avoid oblique tunnels (i.e. more vertical) = to reduce surface area of physis involved
    - Avoid interference screw
- Partial physeal sparing techniques?
    - which will you spare? I will spare the femur
