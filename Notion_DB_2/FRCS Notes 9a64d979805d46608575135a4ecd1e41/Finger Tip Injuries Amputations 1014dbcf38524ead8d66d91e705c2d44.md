### Finger Tip Injuries

- What is the anatomy of the finger tip?
    - Eponychium - aka cuticle. Small amount of thin skin over lunula
    - Paronychium - sides of nail
    - Hyponychium - tip of finger below nail
    - Lunula - corresponds to distal end of germinal matrix
        
        ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled.png)
        
    - Germinal Matrix
    - Sterile Matrix - nail ned
- Classification for finger tip injuries?
    - Allen’s
        - 1 - finger tip
        - 2 - involve nail bed but not bone
        - 3 - involve bone; distal to lunula
        - 4 = proximal to lunula, distal to DIPJ
            
            ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%201.png)
            
    - Favorability
        - Favourable = more palmar skin
        - Neutral
        - Unfavourable = less palmar skin
- What is the management for finger tip injuries?
    - 1. Is there remaining nail matrix distal to eponychium?
        - > 25 % remaining = keep length.
        - If < 25% remaining = revision amputation
    - 2. If for salvage, what kind of coverage?
        - **No** **bone exposed**
            - < 1cm2 = dressings
            - > 1cm2 = full thickness graft from forearm or flap
        - **Bone exposed** = need flap
    - 3. If Flap, what kind of flap?
        
        ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%202.png)
        
- What are the finger flap options?
    - If Volar **favorable**
        - If pulp length > 75% ➔ **VY plasty**
        - If pulp length < 75% ➔ Local Neurovascular island flap
    - If Volar **Unfavorable**
        - **Thumb** = Moberg advancement Flap, Littler neurovascular island glap, cross finger flap
            
            ![Littler Flap](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%203.png)
            
            Littler Flap
            
            ![Thumb cross finger flap](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%204.png)
            
            Thumb cross finger flap
            
        - **IF, MF** = Thenar flap
        - **MF** = Reverse Vascular Island Flap
        - **RF, LF** = Cross Finger Flap
        - **Free flap options** - radial forearm, toe pulp, groin flap
- What is a cross finger flap?
    - Flap harvested from the dorsal side of adjacent finger
    - Donor site covered with full thickness skin graft
    - Divided after 2-3 weeks
- What is a Reverse Vascular Island Flap?
    - “Based on the reverse flow from contralateral communicating artery to digital artery”
        
        ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - Skin flap harvested proximally along finger
    - Rotated with digital artery to cover defect
- What is a Thenar Flap?
    - Flap derived from thenar eminence, post op immobilise in splint; flap division in 2 weeks.
    - (+) provides **glabrous** skin unlike cross finger flap/ grafts
    - (-) flexion contractures and unsightly donor site scars [Brian Rinker 2006 retrospective analysis found no significant flexion contractures and no problematic donor sites]
        
        ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%206.png)
        
- What is a Local NVI Flap?
    - Skin island raised just proximal to skin defect with its NVB
        
        ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - Island advanced into wound
    - Donor site covered with graft
- What is a moberg flap? (#❗️ )
    
    ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - **Midlateral** incision, **dorsal** to neurovascular bundles
    - Flap dissected off flexor tendon sheath
    - Advanced with the NV bundles, helped by **flexion of IPJ**
    - If flap too much tension, can make a proximal transverse incision with FTSG coverage over secondary defect
- Management of sububgal hematomas?

### Finger Amputations

- What is optimal on-site care?
    - Cool to 4 degrees sufficient
    - Wrapped amputated part in a moist gauze of normal saline ➔ placed in bag ➔ into a chest containing crush ice and water.
    - Direct contact with ice will lead to crystallisation and irreversible damage due to frotst bite
    - Aim for 4 ° C, because < 4 ° leads to crystalization damage
- How do you assess the amputate?
    - Assess for poor prognostics of replantation (avulsion type injury) -
    - **Ribbon** sign - severe traction and torsion of vessel
    - **Red line** sign (on amputtee) - denotes small hematomas along the course of the NVB
        
        ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%2010.png)
        
    - Storage technique - if poorly stored may lead to poor prognosis
    - Confirm ischemic time
- How do you describe level of amputation/ flexor tendon injury?
    - Verdan's zones:
        - 1 = Distal to FDS (only FDP injured)
        - 2 = FDS to A1 pulley (no man's land)
        - 3 = A1 to CT
        - 4 = CT
        - 5 = proximal to CT
        
        ![Untitled](Finger%20Tip%20Injuries%20Amputations%201014dbcf38524ead8d66d91e705c2d44/Untitled%2011.png)
        
- ‼️ ⚠️ Classification of finger avulsion?
    - **Urbaniak** classification based on vascular injury
    - Class 1 = circulation ok
    - Class 2 = circulation disrupted but
        - 2A = arterial only
        - 2B = arterial + bone/Tendon/ nerve injury [Mx = Amputation]
    - 3 = **complete** degloving or complete amputation [Mx = **Completion** Amputation]
- Why is avulsion worse than guillotine type of amputation?
    - 1. **Larger zone of injury** ➔ more skin die back
    - 2. Due to avulsion of NV, Usually **need a vein graft so worse prognosis**
    - 2. Expect more **skin** **die back**
- ‼️ When will you consider finger replantation?
    - Depends on patient and injury factors - **RECLAIM**
        - **R** - Requirements of patient - function
        - **E** - Expectations of patient
        - **C** - Comorbids - unable to tolerate long op
        - **L** - level of injury - amputation proximal to palm, multiple digits, thumb
        - **A** - age of patient (child is relative indication)
        - **I** - ischemia time
        - **M** - MOI - avulsion of clean cut, segmental
- What are some contraindications, absolute and relative, to replantation?
    - **Absolute contraindications**
        - Unable to tolerate long op
        - Urbaniak 2B/3
        - Segmental
        - Prolonged ischemia time
    - **Relative contraindications**
        - Severe contamination
        - Single digit at zone 2 (poor function/ stiff)
        - Patient - mentally unstable, self inflicted
- What are the warm and cold ischemia times?
    - **Distal** to carpus < 12 hr [warm] , < 24 hr [cold]
    - **Proximal** to carpus < 6 hr [warm] , < 12 hr [cold]
- What options of management?
    - Shortening and closure - in biocontamination
    - Replantation
- How will you proceed with **replanatation**?
    - Pre-op, intra-op, post op
    - Pre-op
        - P1, ensure within ischemia times, ASAP
        - Anaesthesia - block to block sympathetic system ➔ help w vasodilation
        - 2 teams, II, K-wires
    - Intraop
        - “2-team approach” = benchwork team and **debridement** team
        - Repair “structure by structure” rather than “finger by finger” ➔ faster and higher viability
        - Sequence of structures (**BEFANVS - BE a FAN of V**) : Bone (consider **shortening**) ➔ extensor then flexor tendon (stability) ➔ artery ➔ nerve ➔ vein (2 veins to 1 artery) ➔ skin
        - Sequence of fingers: **Thumb** ➔ Long ➔ Ring ➔ small ➔ index (1/3/4/5/2) [loss of index finger is less morbid]
        - For *Major replant* consider post replanatation fasciotomies
    - Post Op monitoring
- What do you order post replanatation?
    - **Environment** - warm, hourly paras, I/O Charting, good hydration
    - **Diet** - keep NBM for first 24 hours then caffeine free, no chocolate, no nicotine
    - **Anticoagulation** - **aspirin** (only for finger tip replant. Proximal replant no evidence for anticoagulation), nerve block to help w vasodilation
    - **Monitoring -** Skin colour, cap refill, tissue turgor, skin temperature, oxygen saturation (< 94%)
- What is the threshold for skin temperature change before you intervene?
    - Skin temp most reliable - looking for **> 2 ° drop in an hour**
- What are complications to watch for?
    - **< 12 hr** = Most common **arterial thrombosis from vasospasm**
        - Release bandage, place extremity in dependant position, heparin; early exploration
    - **> 12 hr** = **Venous congestion**
        - Remove dressings, elevate
        - Medicinal leeches
        - Revision of venous anastomoses is last resort
    - Other early complications - myoglobinuria, reperfusion injury
    - Late
        - Infection
        - Stiffness - replanted fingers have 50% total motion
        - Neuroma
        - non-union
- How do you address venous congestion?
    - External bleeding, dermal pocketing
- What is the outcome of replanted digits?
    - "Half as good"
    - 50% active ROM
    - Sensation 2PD 10mm with long term cold intolerance.
- Any special **thumb** procedures?
    - 1. **Wrap Around** procedure ideal for amputations distal to the MCPJ as the thumb has no movable joints but recreates an aesthetic replica
        - Harvesting a flap with nail from the great toe, and bone from the iliac crest to recreate toe.
        - doi2002.pdf
    - 2. **Pollicization** with index finger
    - 3. **Toe to Thumb transfer** (great toe or second toe)
        - Great toe superior for aesthetics but higher donor morbididy
        - Blood supply = First dorsal Metatarsal artery (FDMA)
- **Proximal amputation** management?
    - The focus here is **ATLS Resuscitation** and **Cooling of amputate** and benchwork.

    - **Debridement** - Excise necrotic, avulsed muscles - bleeding, consistency, contractility, colour
    - **2 teams** debridement of each
    - **Shunting**
        - Do arterial to arterial shunt and let it bleed through to reduce re-perfusion injury. How long to shunt for?
            - Usually **shunt for 15-20minutes**. This number is taken from tourniquet studies to wash out the acidotic metabolites

- FRCS VIVA CASE
    - Look at cascade of fingers carefully! - here it is clear that flexors are all cut!
    - Allens Test - for any wrist laceration. may have normal cap refill, but may fail allens test
    - XR!
    - If FDS, FDP are cut in the wrist surely the N V are cut also!
    - Complications
        - Tendon adhesion - leading to problem with motion
