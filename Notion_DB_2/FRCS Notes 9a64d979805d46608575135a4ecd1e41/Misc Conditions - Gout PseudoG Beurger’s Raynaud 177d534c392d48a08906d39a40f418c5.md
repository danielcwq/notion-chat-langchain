### Gout

- What is gout?
    - Inflammatory arthritis caused by intra-articular **monosodium urate crystal** deposition
- What are the types of gout?
    - **Primary** - **idiopathic** disorder of **nucleic acid (purine) metabolism** that leads to hyper-urecemia
    - **Secondary** gout - due to high metabolic turn over
        - Psoriasis
        - hemolytic anemias
        - leukemia
        - Chemotherapy
- What are the complications of gout?
    - Gouty renal stones
    - Gouty tophi near joints
    - Septic arthritis - can predispose to infection
- What Investigations?
    - **Bloods** - Raised Serum uric acid **> 400 micromol/Litre**
    - **XR** - punched out periarticular erosions “rat bitten”
    - **Aspirate -** negatively birefringent needle shaped crystals
- What is the management?
    - MDT with rheumatologist
    - **Acute** -
        - Colchicine (if no history of renal impairment or will require renal adjusted dosing)
        - NSAIDS
    - **Chronic** - Allopurinol - a **xanthine oxidase inhibitor**

### Pseudogout

- What is Pseudogout?
    - Calcium ProphosPhate **Dihydrate** [CPPD] Crystal deposition
- What is the crystal?
    - Positively bi-refringent Rhomboid shaped crystal
- What do you see on XR?
    - **Chondrocalcinosis** - calcification of fibrocartilage structures e.g meniscus, TFCC

- What is Buerger’s disease?
    - 3 key words
    - **Non Artherosclerotic (not a plaque)**, **Segmental**, **Inflammatory** disease in small and medium sized vessels of hands and feet
    - aka Thomboangiitis Obliterans
- What is the cause?
    - Cause is unknown
    - But strong association with Smoking and toboacco chewing
- Pathophysiology of Buerger’s?
    - 3 phases
        - **Acute** - thrombus occludes vessel lumen
        - **Subacute** - Progressive organization of thrombus
        - **Chronic** - Thrombus organized and vascular fibrosis remain
- What clinical findings?
    - Allen’s test - expect occlusion of segmental arteries
- What investigations?
    - Angiogram - **corkscrew** collaterals around areas of occlusion

### Raynaud's Phenomenon

- What is Raynaud's phenomenon?
    - Episodic digital ischemia with typical colour changes due to vasospasm of the capillaries
        - **White** - vasospasm
        - **Blue** - pooling of deoxyHb
        - **Red** - due to hyperemia - a/w pain and dysthesia due to vasoilation

- What conditions associated with raynaud?
    - Scleroderma, Inflammatory conditions, blood coagulopathies
- What is the management of Raynaud's?
    - Non op - gloves, stop smoking, beta blockers, calcium blockers
