Topic: Spine

- What is the Denis Column theory?
    - Anterior = ALL + Anterior 2/3 VB
    - Middle = Posterior 1/3 + PLL
    - Posterior = PLC = SS, IS, LF, Facet capsule
- Why put C-collar when lumbar spine injury?
    - 10-20% risk of contiguous injuries
- Will you get MRI of whole spine?
    - Yes
    - epidural hematoma
    - 10% non-contiguous cervical spine fracture (Katsura et al. J. Ortho 2016)
- How will you classify this injury?
    - **By Severity = TLICS**
        - Looking at 3 components - morphology, neurology, PLC involvement; **total is 10**
        - Neurology - note that complete cord lower score
        - Morphology - distraction worse than translation
        - < 4 non op; 4 indeterminate; > 4 surgical
        - **Chance** fracture at least 4 + 3 = 7 even without neurology
        - **Burst** fracture with PLC involvement 2 + 3 = 5 even without neurology

    - By Morphology = AO Trauma
        - A = compression and burst
        - B = tension band (chance)
        - C = Translational

### OSTEOPOROTIC COMPRESSION FRACTURES

- What investigations?
    - Need TRO pathological causes before labelling as osteoporotic
    - FBC, ESR, CRP
    - KIV urine and serum electrophoresis for **multiple myeloma**
    - MRI usually not necessary unless TRO tumor
- ‼️ Management of compression fracture?
    - No consensus on optimal management. Multiple RCT on Lancet and NEJM shows conflicting results on the efficacy of cementoplasty.
    - UK NICE Guidelines 2013 simply recommends cementoplasty for patients who meets 3 criteria
        - **“severe pain”** after
        - **“recent”** unhealed VB fracture AND
        - pain **confirmed at the level with imaging.**
    - **No mention of duration**

    - Thus, I will guide my treatment based on review by Sahota et al. in Injury
    - I will trial non op for **6 weeks**
    - If improving ➔ continue non op
    - If not ➔ MRI ➔ if presence of unhealed feature with bone edema ➔ consider Cementoplasty

- Evidence for cementoplasty?
    - Very Heterogenous results
    - Against - [NEJM]
        - Rachelle buchbinder NEJM **AUSTRALIAN** RCT 2009. Pain < 12 months MRI bone edema. VP **no difference from placebo.**

- How will you treat this elderly compression fracture?
    - Aware of the heterogenous results in literature
    - Based on UK nice guidelines in 2013, 3 criteria can be used to decide to treat with cementoplasty
        - “severe pain” after
        - “recent” unhealed VB fracture AND
        - pain confirmed at the level with imaging.
    - However, no guidelines on duration is given
    - Aware of the highly heterogenous results published in NEJM and Lancet recently
    - Most recent VERTOS 4 trial published in BMJ. **RCT of 180 patients** with median 6 weeks of back pain
        - **Vertebroplasty vs sham with subcutaneous lidocaine**
        - No difference at 1 month vs 12 months
    - In my hands, I will treat with analgesia, PT, kIV bracing for comfort. if after 6 weeks persistent pain will consider vertebroplasty as per UK NICE guidelines
- Patient was treated non op. 2 months later, presents with acute pain and CES symptoms. What has happened?
    - Sudden progression of compression to burst fracture in setting of severe osteoporosis [**senile burst fracture]**
    - Mx = **Transpedicular decompression with posterior stabilization** by a screw-rod construct offers a good chance for neurological improvement, simultaneously correcting the kyphotic deformity at the affected spinal level fairly well.
- How does cementoplasty work in compression #?
    - 2 proposed MOI:
        1. improved biomechanics with cement; 
        2. **exothermic** effects can kill nerve endings, reducing pain
- What is the difference between Kyphoplasty vs Vertebroplasty
    - KP = + balloon first to create void and thus potential for reduction
- Technique tips for cementoplasty?
    - Location: Inject cement not too far posterior
    - Volume = 13-16% VB volume. As most VB is 30mls, that will be about 4mls.
- Complications of cementoplasty?
    - Cement leakage
    - Adjacent segment fracture
    - Pneumothorax

### BURST FRACTURES

- What are XR features of burst fracture?
    - Widening of pedlcles, retropulsion, kyphotic deformity
- Why does neurology not correlate with severity on imaging?
    - Deficit is related to initial injury
    - Neurology is proportionate to the maximum canal occlusion and neural compression at the **moment of impact**
- What cord structures are also injured?
    - Dural injury
    - Predictors of dural injury are the presence of laminar fractures, extent of burst (interpedicular distance) and size of retropulsed segment
- Management for BURST + SOLITARY RADICULOPATHY?
    - Can be treated non operatively
    - Several studies show 75% to 100% neurological recovery for radicular symptoms based on review by So Kato et al. 2017 JOT.

- ‼️ Is bracing required for stable burst fracture?
    - Controversial. Theoretically can prevent deformity and kyphosis
    - **Wallace et al. JBJS meta-analysis of RCTS 2019.** Similar clinical and radiological outcomes with or without bracing at long term f/u of 5 years for STABLE burst fractures without neurology.

- ‼️ If brace what kind of brace?
    - T8-L4 = **TLSO**
    - T10-L2 (junctional) = Jewett Brace with 3 point fixation
    - T1-T7 = TLSO + Cervical spine extension
    - L5-S1 = TLSO + leg extension
- Surgical principles for burst fracture?
    - **Decompression** can be direct or indirect
        - Direct = removal of fragments
        - Indirect = by ligamentotaxis by restoring VB height
    - **Fixation or Fusion** with Modern pedicle screws allow 2 level above 2 level below under **distraction** to restore vertebral height
        - Naresh does 1 level up and 1 level down
    - Plan for ROI in 1-2 years

- Burst Fractures - How to decide Posterior or need to add anterior procedure?
    - Classifx by **comminution** = McCormack-Gaines LOAD SHARING Classifx (LSC) - 1994
    - 3 components - Extent of **comminution**, **Apposition** of fragments, **Reducibility**

    - Principle is that in high score, **no load sharing** ➔ high cantilever bending loads on posterior fixation
        - > 7 points may require anterior approach with vertebrectomy + strut grafting
        - < 7 posterior approach w screw and rods sufficient
    - However, many recent studies show that with new pedicle screws, Short-segment posterior instrumentation is sufficient to treat burst fracture REGARDLESS of LSC
        
        [](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2192568219856581)
        
- Open vs MIS?
    - No difference

- Short (1 up 1 down) vs Long (2 up 2 down) segment fusion for burst fracture?
    - Controversial.
    - Traditionally, long segment fusion advocated to reduce risk of kyphosis.
    - However, recent studies find short segment fusion with modern pedicle screws and rods to be equally effective
    - **Meta-analysis by Tarek et al. Asian Spine Journal 2017.**
        - 9 trials, 365 patients
        - No difference in radiological outcome, functional outcome, neurologic improvement or implant failure rate.
    - In my hands I will do long segment fusion

- Do you need fusion/ arthrodesis in burst fracture?
    - Traditionally, arthrodesis is done to promote final biological stabilization, and to theoretically reduce the incidence of reccurrent kyphosis
    - But Require bone grafting ➔ longer op, higher morbidity
    - **Jindal et al. JBJS August 2012** - RCT of 50 patients. Fusion vs non fusion. Fusion was via decortication of posterior elements and bone grafting for ICBG. Not interbody fusion.
        - Blood **transfusion** requirements, **Duration** of surgery higher in fusion
        - No clinical or radiological difference in outcomes between groups

    - On the other hand, fixation and subsequently implant removal hopes to maintain mobility of the spine to prevent adjacent segment disease in the future

- Do we need to remove implants if you ORIF?
    - Controversial; not necessary but risk of screw breakage
    - Chou et al. JBJS retrospective analysis of 69 patients; follow up of 5 years.
        - Radiological and functional outcomes of both implant removal and retention is similar.

### CHANCE FRACTURE

- What is a chance fracture?
    - It is a 3 column injury with FULCRUM AT Anterior Longitudinal ligament
    - It can be bony chance which have better healing OR ligamentous chance
- Associated injuries?
    - GIT injury in 50%

- Surgical principles for chance fractures?
    - Short (single level up and down) vs long segment (2 levels up and down) remains controversial. Most authors recommend Long segment fixation
    - However, some advocate single level fixation to preserve spinal motion even in type B, CHANCE fractures.
        
        [Current status of short segment fixation in thoracolumbar spine injuries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7452221/)
        
    - Modifications to short segment fixation has also been described such as screws through the level of the fracture.
        
        [Outcomes of Including Fracture Level in Short-Segment Fixation for Thoracolumbar Fracture Dislocation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6365787/)
        
    - Opn vs MIS?
        - No difference in kyphotic deformity
- Any difference between bony and ligamentous chance injury?
    - Some surgeons treat bony chance fractures conservatively with immobilisation in a thoracolumbosacral orthosis in an extension position with 2-week follow-up for non-union and degree of kyphosis deformity.
    - However, I will base my treatment on the TLICS score, and it is considered and unstable injury
