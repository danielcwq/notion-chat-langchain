- How to do you check rigid or flexible flat foot?
    - Tip toe
    - Jack's test - dorsiflex big toe, activate windlass mechanism of plantar fasciia. In flexible flat foot, it should correct.

### TARSAL COALITION [Unilateral flat feet]

![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%201.png)

- ‼️ ⚠️ What is the etiology of tarsal coalition?
    - **Failure of mesenchymal segmentation** leading to coalition between two or three tarsal bones
    - Develops into a fibrous coalition, or undergoes **metaplasia** to cartilage +/- bone
- What is it associated with?
    - Fibula Hemimelia
- ‼️ ⚠️ Where is the coalition? Age of onset?
    - 2/3 is Calcaneonavicular, 1/3 is Talocalcaneum
    - CN before TC - CN 8-12yo [8-12 years]; TC 12-15 yo [12-15 years]
- What are the types of tarsal coalition?
    - Fibrous/ Cartilaginous/ Osseous
- ‼️ What **spasticity** can they develop?
    - Peroneal spasticity
- Xr signs?
    - CN = anteater sign on oblique
        
        ![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - TC = C sign on lateral
        
        ![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%203.png)
        
- What advanced imaging?
    - CT scan to rule out additional coalitions - incidence 5%
- What is the surgical management?
    - < 50% bar = excise, interpositon arthroplasty with fat/ FHL, post tib tendon sheath
    - **> 50% bar** = subtalar arthrodesis after correcting deformity
    - Salvage = triple arthrodesis (=ST, TN, CC)
- ‼️ What surgical approach to tarsal coalition?
    
    [avoid mentioning approaches]
    
    - **CN - Ollier’s approach [perpendicular to Sinus Tarsi approach]**
        - Oblique incision beginning at sinus tarsi soft spot just anterior to lateral malleolus posteriorly to 2.5cm below tip of distal malleolus
            
            ![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%204.png)
            
        - Plane: Peroneus tertius (DPN) // Brevis (SPN)
        - Resect with fat/ EDB interposition
    - **TC = medial limb of Cincinnati incision**
        - Curved incision medial side of foot, centered over sustenaculum tali
        - Plane: FDL // Neurovascular bundle

![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%205.png)

- Describe Short case of Calaneovalgus?
    - Neonate foot, skin approaching anterior shin.
    - Look for other packaging disorders
    - Look for spine - L5 spinal dysraphism can lead to calcaneovalgus
    - History from parents
- What are the other **packaging** disorders? [Top to bottom]
    - Plagiocephaly
    - Congenital muscular torticollis
    - DDH
    - Congenital Knee Dislocation
    - Posteromedial tibia bowing
    - Metatarsus Adductus
    - Calcaneovalgus foot
- How to differentiate from CVT?
    - Position of the calcaneum. in congenital vertical talus, calcaneum is in equinus

- Management of calcaneovalgus?
    - Observation with passive stretching

### CONGENITAL VERTICAL TALUS

![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%206.png)

- Describe, Short case of CVT?
    
    ![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - Pes Planus foot, rocker bottom, flexed toes
    - **Hindfoot** - in equinus with calcaneum point down
    - **Midfoot** - dorsiflexed and abducted with dorsal lateral skin crease
    - Expect to find **talar head** prominent medially
    - No callus/ ulcerations
    - Examine further for correctability and complications of deformity
    - Assess **spine** for myelodysplasia and other joints for athrogryposis
- What is CVT?
    - *“It is a teratalogic disorder with the navicular dorsally dislocated on the talus which is irreducible”*
    - Irreducible **dorsal dislocation of navicular on talus** ➔ rigid flatfoot
    - A teratologic disorder (vs packaging disorder that is OVT)
- Etiology of CVT?
    - Idiopathic vs syndromic
    - aw **myelodysplasia [Look at spine]** , arthrogryposis [look at other joints], CP, SMA
- ‼️ ⚠️ What conditions associated with CVT? What Gene?
    - Gene is **HOXD10 gene**
    - a/w Arthrogryposis, Spinal dysraphism, cerebral palsy, SMA
- ⚠️ What is Oblique Vertical Talus OVT?
    - It is a less severe form of CVT
    - In OVT, the **talus is aligned when foot is plantar flexed** (A and B and C).
    - But CVT is misaligned in both plantar or dorsiflexion (D)
        
        ![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%208.png)
        
- How do you differentiate between calvaneovalgus?
    - By the position of the calcaneum. In CVT, calcaneus is point down (equinus) while in calcaneovalgus, it is point up
    
    ![Untitled](Paeds%20Foot%20-%20Pes%20Planus%20Tarsal%20Coalition%20CV%20CVT%20AN%20317d409358cb49798f8302f2beba2124/Untitled%209.png)
    
- What do you see on XR?
    - **Talus** being vertical. **Calcaneus** is in equinus
    - THis is determined by comparing the axis of the talus and the 1st MT-cuneiform exis
- ‼️ ⚠️ Management of CVT?
    - **Dobb’s** serial casting ("reverse ponsetti")
    - **Goal** is to bring the foot that is “out and up” to “down and in”
    - **4-6** week duration of **weekly** **Toe to groin cast**, goal is to maximum plantar flexion and inversion (club foot position)
    - Using the right foot as a reference
    - The Right thumb is placed at the medial aspect of the talar neck as the fulcrum, pushing it dorsally and laterally
        - Like ponseti, the fulcrum is at the talus but unlike ponseti, using the direction of manipulation is that the navicular is plantar flexed and translated medial
    - Left hand manipulate the navicular into plantar flexion and adduction
    - Cast until Navicular is reduced (based on 1st MT cuneiform axis ➔ percutaneous **talonavicular pinning** + TA tenotomy
    - [Most] **Surgical soft tissue procedures if unsuccessful at 1 year old**
        - Peroneus Brevis (contracted due to lateral subluxation)**fractionated** if adduction < 10
        - EHL, EDC fractionation (chronic contractures) if plantar flexion < 25
        - TA lengthening (chronic equinus)
        - with Talonavicular pinning
    - Long leg **cast x 5/52**
    - Followed by **Foot abduction orthosis** - Brace as per ponseti method (except that brace is neutral rather than ER)
- What are the salvage procedures?
    - Talectomy
    - Triple arthrodesis (TN, CC, ST)

### ACCESSORY NAVICULAR

- What is the classification?
    - Geist
    - Type 1 = sesamoid bone embedded **in tendon**
    - 2 = attached to navicular by **fibrocartilage**
    - 3 = **Fused** to navicular

- What is the management?
    - Non op
    - Approach - medial incision dorsally over navicular
    - Op = **Kidner Procedure** = excision of accessory bone and reattaching Post tib tendon to navicular
