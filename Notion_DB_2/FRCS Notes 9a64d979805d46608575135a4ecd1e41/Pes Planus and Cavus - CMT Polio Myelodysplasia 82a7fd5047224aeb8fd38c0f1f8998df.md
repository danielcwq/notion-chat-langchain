## Pes Planus

- ‼️ What are the causes of flat foot?
    - **Acquired** -
        - PTTD most common (May be secondary to **RA**)
        - trauma
        - inflammatory
    - **Congenital** -
        - Idiopathic
        - Vertical talus
        - Calcaneovalgus (L5 myelodysplasia)
        - Tarsal coalition
        - Acccessory navicular
        - Cerebral palsy diplegic type (hemiplegic causes pes cavovarus)
- What is the attachment of the posterior tibial tendon?
    - Main attachment is over the navicular
    - With several secondary attachments - lateral cuneiform, medial cuneiforms and the metatarsal bases, cuboid[https://jfootankleres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13047-020-00392-1](https://jfootankleres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13047-020-00392-1)
    
    ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled.png)
    
- What is the antaganoist of Posterior tibial tendon?
    - Antagonist of PTT = Peroneus Brevis
    - Strong PB and weak PT will lead to the foot being abducted ➔ talonavicular uncoverage the too many toes sign.
- Why is the Posterior tendon prone to injury?
    - Water shed area 2-6cm from attachment ➔ risk of tendon dengeration ➔ incompentence
- What is the pathophysiology?
    - **Degeneration ➔ Tenosynovitis ➔ Medial ligaments strain ➔ bony deformity**
    - Tendon degeneration occurs in watershed region distal to medial malleolus
    - Begins as **tenosynovitis** and becomes painful tendon that **lacks excursion**
    - Unable to fulfill role as midfoot inverter to lock transverse tarsal joint for toe off ➔ leading to stresses on medial ligaments ➔ Spring ligamemnt
    - ➔ Unopposed action of the **Peroneus brevis** pulls the forefoot into abduction
    - ➔ **Achilles tendon** now becomes a everter of the heel causing worsening valgus deformity.
    - Bony deformities occur at later stage
- How does action of posterior tibial tendon helps in toe off?
    - Posterior tibial tendon acts in **inverter** of the transverse tarsal joint, locking it to become a stiff lever arm, allowing efficient toe off
    - **TN and CC joints** (transverse tarsal joint aka chopart joint)

        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%202.png)
        
    - When in **eversion** (at rest), axes of both joints are **parallel** and joint is relaxed
        - Foot is mobile and can adapt to uneven ground
    - When in **inversion** (by action of Post tib), axes **diverge** and joint is locked
        - Becomes a stiff lever arm for push off
- What to ask in history?
    - Hx = trauma, **inflammatory** arthritis, symptoms, lateral impingement, pain
- Clinical features of Pes Planus?
    - Pain over lateral malleolus ➔ due to lateral ankle impingement [**Subfibular impinvement**]
    - Inspect - too many toes, valgus hindfoot, **supinated** forefoot, callus, foot wear
    - Gait
    - **Single leg calf raise -** if unable = Stage 2 PTTD
    - **Jack's test** = flexible? If not correctable = Stage 3/4
        - Dorsiflex big toe should cause medial arch to elevate due to windlass effect if subtalar joint is flexible
    - Silverskoid test - all FA conditions

- What lines on XR for Pes Planus or Cavus?
    - **Lateral XR**
        - Calcaneal pitch [17-30 degrees]
        - Meary's angle - apex inferior for pes planus; apex superior for pes cavus [-4 to 4]
            - Angle between line drawn through longitudinal axis of talus and 1st MT
        - [Cavus] Sinus Tarsi see through sign
    - **AP XR [Planus only]**
        - [Planus] Talonavicular uncoverage - looking at forefoot abduction (due to **peroneus brevis pulling**)
            - 1 line drawn connecting talus articular surface; another line connecting edge of navicular articular surface. Angle between
            - Described as **percentage**
                
                ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%203.png)
                
            - OR talonavicular angle [< 7 deg]

        - [Planus] **Kite's angle (Talocalcaneal angle)** [< 30 deg] (looking at hindfoot valgus/ calcaneus eversion)
            - Angle between lines drawn down the **axis of the talus** and **calcaneus** measured on a weight-bearing DP foot radiograph
                
                ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%205.png)
                
- What classification for Pes Planus?
    - † + Myerson added 4th stage
    - Stage 1 = NO DEFORMITY. Single leg raise OK.
    - Stage 2 = DEFORMITY PRESENT [Flexible deformity].May or may not be able to do a single leg raise. (may be weak) - Jacks test +ve
        - 2A = TN uncoverage **< 40%**
        - 2B = TN uncoverage **> 40%** (forefoot abduction)
    - 3 = + **Subtalar** **Arthritis** [rigid deformity - Jack's test -ve]
    - 4 = + **Tibiotalar** **arthritis** (tilting talus) (rigid)
- What is non operative management? What is the classic insole?
    - [28. Orthotics](28%20Orthotics%20c73ab16057f24c5380ca9f0bd3f1c1b5.md)
    - UCBL - university of california Berkley
        
        
        - What is this (UCBL)?
            - This is UCBL orthosis (University of California Berkeley Laboratories). It is a **rigid** plastic insert used to control severe hind foot valgus and midfoot pronation (used in PTTD)
            - It is a **corrective** orthosis
            - Designed to maintain the hindfoot in neutral position, **locking the transverse tarsal** joints and limiting pronation (essentially takes over the job of posterior tibial tendon to lock the transverse tarsal joint)
            
    - Medial posting insoles ➔ to correct valgus hindfoot, to correct line of pull of achilles tendon to prevent it from worsening valgus deformity
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Calf stretching ➔ every foot and ankle pathology has issue with gastrocnemius
- ⚠️ ‼️ What is the surgical **management** for **Flexible PTTD Stage 2B**?
    - Goals = PPPSS (painless, plantigrade, pliable, Shoeable, Stable)
    - Can be divided into soft tissue and bony procedures. "Typically for soft tissue, I will do a FDL to Medial cuneiform transfer, and a **gastroc** release, spring ligament recon. Bony procedures wise I will do a MCO if it is insufficient, I may consider a cotton's osteotomy or a lateral column lengthening osteotomy
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - **Soft tissue Procedure (3)**
        - Tendon transfer – **FDL to Medial cuneiform** OR **Cobb's procedure** (use of Anterior tibialis tendon **Do not mention this for FRCS)
        - **Spring** ligament reconstruction (autograft, allograft, synthetic Internal brace)
        - (If Silverskoid +ve) Gastroc release, Tendoachilles Lengthening (tight gastroc worsens hindfoot valgus moment forces)
    - **Bony Procedures (4)**
        - **MCO** = Medializing calcaneum osteotomy ➔ changes vector of achilles tendon.
        - If still not enough ➔ **Lateral column lengthening osteotomy [Evan's Osteotomy]** –through the calcaneum
            
            ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%208.png)
            
        - **Cotton’s Osteotomy** – Medial cuneiform *dorsal opening osteotomy* to correct forefoot
            
            ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%209.png)
            
        - **Arthroreisis** screw “subtalar stenting” – controversial
    - SOA Inderjit Singh = For 2B he use 4 procedures - Tendoachilles Lengthening, MCO, FDL transfer, LCLO
- How do you harvest the FDL?
    - **Henry’s knot** – FDL is superficial at the knot
    - Harvest more proximal to the Henry's knot
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- After harvesting FDL, will there be any deficit in the toes?
    - No, there are a number of fibrous interconnections between the 2 tendons
    - So flexion of digits can still continue after harvet of either FDL or FHL
- Why do you use the FDL?
    - It is synergistic with the PTT and is easily accessible.
- What tendon transfers do you know for PTTD?
    - FDL to medial cuneiform
    - Cobb's procedure ➔ partial Anterior Tibial Tendon graft rerouted through the 1st cuneiform
- What are the options of gastroc release?
    - Proximal vs Distal
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2011.png)
        
    - Distal - e.g. Strayer
- Why will you choose PMGR?
    - Distal section involves the gastroc tendon and aponeurosis of soleus, may be hard to separate. So distal section is not always pure gastroc lengthening
    - Distal section can lead to interruption of muscle continuity ➔ leads to weakness
- How do you do a proximal medial gastroc release (PMGR)?
    - Prone position
    - Posterio medial transverse incision made on or just below the posterior knee crease
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2012.png)
        
    - Crural fascia is divided longitudinally and proximal insertion of medial gastroc is identified
    - Section the white fibers of the medial gastroc
    - Post op - no immobilization required. FWBAT
    - barouk2014.pdf
- What is the surgical **management** for **rigid stage 3 PTTD**?
    - If it is rigid, this is an indication for fusion surgery
    - I will assess which joints are affected - Typically, subtalar joints (TN, TC, CC)
    - I will fuse them accordingly.
    - Talonavicular, Subtalar fusion, +/- calcaneocuboid fusion (If all 3 = triple arthrodesis) [i.e. subtalar joint and chopart/ transverse tarsal joint)
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2013.png)
        
- How will you **manage** a **Rigid, Stage 4 PTTD**?
    - In stage 4, the tibio talar joint is also affected (stage 4), pantalar fusion is an option however, aware it has poor outcomes. I will consider
    - **Talectomy and Tibiocalcaneal fusion** (for very contracted skin in RA and poor skin) OR
    - **Tibio-Talo-Calcaneal fusion (TTC)**
- PTT Op Complications?
    - Overcorrection – leads to lateral overloading

    - **Congenital vs Acquired**
    - **Congenital** -
        - idiopathic
        - *CMT*
        - Sequelae of clubfoot
        - Arthrogryposis,
        - Friedrich's ataxi
        - Cerebral palsy
        - Myelodysplasia AKA Spina Bifida ➔ Neuromuscular Foot
    - **Acquired**
        - **Neuromuscular** - *Polio*, Stroke
        - **Vascular** - previous compartment syndrome Volkmann ischemia
- ‼️ What is the pathoanatomy of CMT?
    - "An imbalance between intrinsics and extrinsics, and between antagonistic muscles"
    - **Posterior tibialis** (Navicular) >> Peroneus Brevis (5MT base) ➔ hindfoot cavus
    - **Peroneus Longus** (1st MT base) >> Tibialis Anterior (MC) ➔ Forefoot pronation
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2015.png)
        
    - Due to **weak intrinsics** ➔ toes go into claw (MPTJ extend and toes are lifted off the ground) ➔ Toe flexors (FDLs) activate to have the pulp touch the ground ➔ worsening clawing of toes
    - With contractures of intrisics muscles ➔ plantar fascia is tightened ➔ accentuate windlass mechanism ➔ further worsening pes cavus

- Why do these neurologic Pes Cavus patients get claw toes?
    - Due to weakness of anterior tibialis tendon ➔ foot drop
    - **EHL and EDL** compensate to extend ankles
    - In order for toe pulp to contact ground ➔ FDL and FHL activates to plantarflex DIPJ
    - Chronically ➔ contracted soft tissue and MTPJ into extension ➔ and causes clawing
- Clinical Assessment?
    - SPINE SPINE SPINE
    - Sensation? inverted champagne bottle LL - CMT
    - Motor? paralytic ➔ Polio
    - Peek a boo heel sign
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2016.png)
        
    - Coleman block test
        - Placing a block on the lateral aspect of the foot. Principle is to unload posterior and lateral tripod.
        - If it is varus corrected, then it is forefoot driven OR flexible
        - If it is uncorrected, then it is hindfoot driven or Rigid hind foot
    - All foot and ankle cases - Silferskoid test
    - **Check SPINE for spinal dysraphism**
- What other investigations you may do?
    - Spine MRI - if concerned about myelodysplasia
- What is the non operative management? what special insole?
    - Insoles – type depends on Coleman block test
    - If forefoot driven – MT recess
    - If hindfoot driven – ”Lateral heel posting” to correct varus hindfoot
- ‼️ What surgical options for **Pes Cavus**?
    - Goals = PPPSS (painless, plantigrade, pliable, Shoeable, Stable)
    - A “combination of soft tissue and bony procedures”, addressing the forefoot or hindfoot first
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2017.png)
        
    - **Soft tissue Procedures**
        - Achilles/ gasctroc release/ lengthening (tight gastroc worsening varus moment forces and also increases plantar pressures in forefoot worsening ulcers/ callus)
        - Tendon transfers – [Principles]
            - **PL to PB transfer** (PL is causing forefoot pronation and 1st ray plantarflexion)
            - **Post tib tendon transfer to lateral cuneiform** or cuboid to augment weak tibialis anterior (post tib is causing inversion)
        - Soft tissue release of CN spring ligament, Plantar fascia
    - **Bony procedures**
        - Calcaneus Lateralizing valgus osteotomy (Dwyer’s)
        - Dorsal closing wedge osteotomy of 1MT ➔ can be done on all 5 MT

        - **Jone's** procedure
            - To reverse claw toes. Orginally described for the hallux, but can also be done for the leseser toes
            - Tendon of EHL cut from its insertion and tied to the 1st MT neck via a medial approach (same as hallux valgus approach)
            - Fix DIPJ with K-wire which is removed after 6 weeks
            - Jone's procedure also for lesser toes

### CHARCOT MARIE TOOTH DISEASE [Bilateral, Sensory loss]

- What is Charcot Marie Tooth disease? What inheritance?
    - It is a hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy (HSMN)
    - There are **7 types of CMT (CMT 1-7) with many subtypes**[https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/CharcotMarie-Tooth-Disease-Fact-Sheet#3092_5](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Charcot-Marie-Tooth-Disease-Fact-Sheet#3092_5)
    - Most common is **CMT 1, which is Autosomal Dominant** and has 6 subtypes. It is demyelinating in nature.
    
    ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2021.png)
    
- How does patients with CMT present?
    - Presents in second decade with peroneal muscle weakness
- What is the pathoanatomy of CMT?
    - "An imbalance between intrinsics and extinsics, and between antagonistic muscles"
    - **Posterior tibialis** (Navicular) >> Peroneus Brevis (5MT base) ➔ hindfoot cavus
    - **Peroneus Longus** (1st MT base) >> Tibialis Anterior (MC) ➔ Forefoot pronation
        
        ![Untitled](Pes%20Planus%20and%20Cavus%20-%20CMT%20Polio%20Myelodysplasia%2082a7fd5047224aeb8fd38c0f1f8998df/Untitled%2022.png)
        
    - Due to **weak intrinsics** ➔ toes go into claw (MPTJ extend and toes are lifted off the ground) ➔ Toe flexors (FDLs) activate to have the pulp touch the ground ➔ worsening clawing of toes
    - With contractures of intrisics muscles ➔ plantar fascia is tightened ➔ accentuate windlass mechanism ➔ further worsening pes cavus

### POLIO [Unilateral, Sensory Intact]

- What is Polio?
    - Polio virus affecting **anterior horn motor cells**
- ‼️ Which muscles do polio affect and what can they present with?
    - Asymmetric, affecting most frequently muscles that have all their anterior horn cells in a small localized area in spinal cord =
        - 1. Tibialis anterior [**pes cavus**],
        - 2. Quadriceps femoris [**recurvatum**],
        - 3. Gluteus Maximus!
        - 4. [UL] **Opponens**
        - 5. [UL] Deltoid,
- ‼️ What are the 4 stages of disease in Polio?
    - **Acute** polio
    - **Recovery** stage aka Convalescent stage - recovery **up to 2 years**
    - **Residual** paralysis stage - no further recovery
    - **Post polio syndrome** (PPS) - 30 to 40 years after acute illness
        - *Gradual or abrupt onset of weakness or muscle fatigue*
        - Cause is unknown; potentially due to the loss of muscle compensation as the patient gets older and weaker.
        - it is a Diagnosis of **exclusion**
- What is the classic gait that Polio has? Why does he walk this way?
    - 4 features in gait
        - ***Hands on thigh gait,***
        - ***Foot drop High steppage gait,***
        - **Tr*endelenberg***
        - **Gluteus Maximus Gait -** due to weak extensors, back lurches backwards
    - Mild **quads weakness** = **hand on thigh gait** is classic to help extend knee when walking
    - Normally, knee is extended by quads during mid stance
    - Due to weakness of quads - knees will buckle (flex)
    - So hands push the thigh to extend the knee (allowing ITB to lock the knee passively)
    - Over time ➔ posterior structures become lax ➔ hyperextension

- How can you manage this gait?
    - Non op - with GRAFO

- ‼️ How do you manage knee OA and recurvatum in polio?
    - Transfer of biceps/ semi T to the front of knee
    - Osteotomy for recurvatum
    - Hinged knee replacement
    - Arthrodesis
- What kind of knee replacement will you do for contralateral normal knee?
    - There is unpredictable PCL integrity due to extensive loading on the contralateral side ➔ will use a PS implant

### STROKE - HEMIPLEGIA

- What kind of foot in stroke?
    - I think we can think it synonymously as a spastic **hemiplegia** cerebral palsy in which Equinocavovarus foot is more common (in diplegia, equinoplanovalgus is more common)

### Foot in MYELODYSPLASIA

- What foot deformity do we expect in **sacral myelodysplasia**?

    - Sacral myelodysplasia means L5 and above intact
    - Elevated longitudinal arch aka cavus is the primary deformity
    - Varus then results from **muscle imbalance** between posterior tibialis  and peroneal muscles
- What Foot deformities do we expect in **Low Lumbar Myeodysplasia**? (L5)

    - L5 lesion means L4 and above intact and dorsiflexion is intact
    - It is most common in patients with L4 or L5 level of involvement, “**due to the strength or spasticity of the ankle dorsiflexors combined with weak or absent plantar flexors**”
    - Calcaneus or Calcaneovalgus.

    - Most common in patients with L5 and L4 levels of involvement due to strength or spasticity of ankle dorsiflexors combined with weak or absent plantar flexors
- Management of calcaneovalgus due to Myelodysplasia?
    - Anterior tibialis tendon transfer to calcaneus with anterolateral ankle release

- What Foot deformity do we expect in **High Lumbar myelodysplasia (L4 and above)**?
    - If lesion is at L4, means L3 and above intact. Means dorsiflexion is also affected.
    - **Equinovarus** foot aka Club foot
    - Occurs in 90% of patients with thoracic or lumbar levels
    - Develop due to **“retained activity of tibialis muscles” in combination with the “functional absence of peroneal muscles”**
- What other proximal muscle weaknesses do we expect for higher lumbar levels?
    - L3 = L4 and below weak = equinovarus foot + foot drop
    - L2 = L3 and below weak = + Knee extensors weak
    - L1 = L2 and below weak = + Hip flexors weak
- Management of non idiopathic club foot associated with spina bifida?
    - Ponseti method - can be successful in most cases.
    - +/- soft tissue release later
