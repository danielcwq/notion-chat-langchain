## METALS

- What are metal alloys?
    - Metals are materials that **contains metallic + non metallic elements** and has electrons that are freely circulating
    - Presence of non metallic elements creates slight deformation in crystal; increases yield strength and resistance to plastic deformation
- How are Metals processed?
    - **Cold working aka strain hardening**. Done below recrystallisation temp . Increases yield stress and UTS but ductility is sacrificed. - “Make metal more deformed so cannot deform anymore”
        - A material that has received prior deformation will be stronger than an undeformed material.
    - **Annealing** = Heat to above recrystallisation temperature and plastically deform the metal ➔ **increases ductility**
    - **Forging [Combination of cold working and annealing]**  = Manufacturing process to optimise material properties using pressure. Can be cold or hot working (relative to recrystaliization temp.)
    - **Alloying**  = adding of materials to interpose within crystals to prevent further dislocations to **increase stiffness**
    - **Quenching** = heated metal suddenly immersed in cold water or oil = improves hardness
- What is Stainless Steel?
    - **Iron** 62%, Chromium 18%, Molybdenum 3%, Nickel 16%, Carbon 0.03% (L = Low Carbon) ["iron chromium MNC"]
    - It is a metal alloy - consisting of metals and non metallic elements in a sea of free ions

- ⚠️ What is titanium?
    - Titanium 89%, Alumnium 6%, Vanadium **4% Others 1%)
    - 6Al-4v = 6% alumnium, 4% vanadium

    - PMMA. Not plastic
- What is the french paradox?
    - The ideal cement mantle thickness is still uncertain and there are 2 philosophies
        - One is that a complete cement mantle of **at least 2mm is ideal**
        - **French paradox** is that which implantation of a canal filling femoral component in **line to line manner** with a thin cement mantle. The reason for good results may be due to a canal filling stem with support by cortical bone.
    - Both techniques have been found to have excellent results
- Have you heard of the Bone Loc Cement?
    - Was designed to improve cement characteristics by reducing **exothermic reaction** during polymerization and lowering residual **monomer** solubility and lowering **airbone** monomoer and aromatic amines
    - Found to **have an unacceptably high failure rate** and is not reccomended for use

## CERAMICS

- What are ceramics?
    - Compounds made of **metallic and non-metallic elements**. Difference from allows is that in metal electrons are free circulating. In ceramics, electrons are in ionic or covalent bonds
- ‼️ How are ceramics manufactured?
    - **4 steps**
    - 1. **Sintering** - mix powder with water ➔ **heated** and **baked** to achieve high density
    - 2. Transformational **toughening** by adding another tetragonal material (e.g. Adding zirconia)
    - 3. Hot isostatic pressing to further **increase density**[3rd gen]
    - 4. Further adding **trigonal** particles - chromium and strontium to limit crack propagation
- ‼️ ⚠️ What are the 4 generations of Biolox?
    - 1st gen - **Alumina oxide** - but undergo transformation I-vivo - catastrophic failures
    - 2nd gen - Add tetragonal zirconia particles [transformational toughening]

        - Prevents crack initiation, acting like “air bags” to absorb impacting forces
    - 3rd gen [Forte] - Add hot isostatic pressing (3rd stage)
    - 4th gen [Delta] - includes **chromium** and **strontium** (trigonal particles) to limit crack propagation
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-07-26 at 2.50.03 PM.png](18%20Biomaterials%20e9b3e8af01824118946ae64afac13422/Screenshot_2022-07-26_at_2.50.03_PM.png)

- Properties of ceramic?
    - Bioinert
    - (+) High wettability for lubrication
    - (-) Brittle (no elastic behaviour), risk of catastrophic failure
        
        ![Untitled](18%20Biomaterials%20e9b3e8af01824118946ae64afac13422/Untitled%204.png)
        
- What other ceramics you know off?
    - Alumina
    - Zirconia
    - Biolox

- How does the ceramic cup (or any brittle material) fail? (Ceramic Castastrophic Failure)
    - Ceramic is a brittle material, and fails by **Crack initiation** and **propagation**
        1. Microscopic cracks can occur from stress
        2. Cracks may become **critical size** and it 
        3. Propagates through the structure in a fast manner, failing suddenly
    - It fails suddenly, soon after the yield point.
    - This is opposed to a ductile material where the cracks keeps getting bigger until the remaining area cannot support the load.
- What are the unique types of the wear in CoC?
    - “edge loading”, “stripe wear”, “patch wear”, “Squeaking”
    - Edge Loading and stripe wear [a type of mode 2 wear, ADHESIVE wear]
        - During process of the liner, there is an inevitable sharp edge at the rim. During Hip movement, femoral head loads against the sharp edge resulting in edge loading
        - Posterior **edge loading** is more commonly seen in comparison to anterior edge loading, and may be associated with micro-separation of the femoral head during the swing phase
        - Associated with **steep cup inclination**, young patients and revision surgery
        - Edge loading is a normal mechanism in CoC articulations and is unavoidable. But considered clinically insignificant as the produced wear volumes are very low to generate osteolysis.
        
        ![Untitled](18%20Biomaterials%20e9b3e8af01824118946ae64afac13422/Untitled%205.png)
        
        - Stripe wear ➔ progresses to patch wear
        
        ![Untitled](18%20Biomaterials%20e9b3e8af01824118946ae64afac13422/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Squeaking
        - Multifactorial in origin, may also be a result in edge loading
        - Implant factors - CoC, not in hard on soft bearings
        - Patient - demands placed on hip. Squeaking tend to occur in young, taller and heavier patients
        - Implant positioning - studies found more squeaking in implants placed outside the safe zone
- What is oxinium?
    
    ![Untitled](18%20Biomaterials%20e9b3e8af01824118946ae64afac13422/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - It is **oxidized zirconium**. It is a product of smith and nephew. Metal alloy with a ceramic surface. (Black)
- What is hydroxyapatite?
    - Hydroxyapatite **Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2**
    - A ceramic that is used as an adjuvant coating on prosthetic cup or stem.
    - it is an osteoconductive agent, readily receiving osteoblasts and reduces gaps.
- How is HA coating done?
    - HA coating is achieved through plasma spray technique, projecting HA particles onto metallic material at high temperatures (15,000°) and under vacuum, at high speeds (300m/s)
- What are the advantages of HA coated stems?
    - Osteoconductive agent, allows for rapid closure of gaps
    - Surface readily receives osteoblasts and provides a bidirectional closure of gaps
- What are the disadvantages of HA stems?
    - High costs and delamination of the HA coating
    - HA particles delaminated from the stem surface may induce osteolysis
